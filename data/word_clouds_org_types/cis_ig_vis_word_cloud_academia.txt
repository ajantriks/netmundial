II  PRINCIPLES AND ACTIONS PROPOSED BY THE EXPERTS
The Experts Meeting on Cyberspace Law 
1  Recognising the interest of UNESCO in the promotion of human rights and fundamental
freedoms in cyberspace particularly in the fields of education  science and culture;
2  Recognising the mandate and the ethical and intellectual mission of UNESCO  its
universal vocation and the transdisciplinary character of its fields of competence;
3  Recognising that current international discussions concerning cyberspace activities and
digital works tend to emphasise economic matters rather than social and cultural
interests;
4  Recognising that the global nature of the Internet raises issues of common concern for
governments and peoples around the world;
5  Recognising the need to work in cooperation with other international organisations
concerned with matters of cyberspace law and the need for international efforts on
harmonisation and to resolve jurisdictional issues;
6  Recognising the open and decentralised character of "cyberspace" as well as its
interactive and dynamic nature  system of electronic linkages  and the irrelevance of
geographic and physical boundaries;
7  Recognising that cyberspace offers benefits and opportunities as well as undesirable
consequences that raise complex issues for humanity 
A  Principles to be promoted by UNESCO 
The Experts Meeting on Cyberspace Law proposes to the Director-General that UNESCO
promote the following principles 
1  Communication Principle 
   The right of communication is a fundamental human right 
2  Participation Principle 
   Every citizen should have the right to meaningful participation in the information
society 
The above key principles embody the concept of every person s right to access the new
environment of cyberspace  in particular 
3  Universal Service Principle 
   States should promote universal services where  to the extent possible given the
different national and regional circumstances and resources  the new media shall be
accessible at community level by all individuals  on a non-discriminatory basis
regardless of geographic location 
4  Multiculturalism and Multilingualism Principle 
   States and users should promote cultural and linguistic diversity in cyberspace by the
promotion of regional and local participation in Internet activities  information
collections  and new information services 
5  Ethics Principle 
   States and users should promote efforts  at the local and international levels  to
develop ethical guidelines for participation in the new cyberspace environment 
6  Education Principle 
   All persons should have a right to appropriate education in order to read  write and
work in cyberspace  There should be specific initiatives to educate parents  children 
teachers and other Internet users on the implications of their participation in
cyberspace and on how to maximise the opportunities presented by the new media 
7  Free Expression Principle 
   States should promote the right to free expression and the right to receive
information regardless of frontiers 
8  Privacy and Encryption Principles 
   The fundamental right of individuals to privacy  including secrecy of communication
and protection of personal data  should be respected in national law and in the
implementation and use of technical methods as well as private legal remedies and
other self-regulatory measures 
9  Access to Information Principle 
   Public bodies should have an affirmative responsibility to make public information
widely available on the Internet and to ensure the accuracy and timeliness of the
information  This information could include government information  information
concerning cultural heritage  and archival and historical information 
   The traditional balance between the rights of authors and limitations on these rights 
including the free use of ideas in published works  should be maintained in
cyberspace in the interests of the public and of the authors 
   States should preserve and expand the public domain in cyberspace 
10  Training Principle 
   Job training in electronic media should be encouraged to enable people to
communicate in the new media and to create new opportunities in employment 
11  International Co-operation Principle 
   States shall co-operate at an international level and seek to harmonise national law
to resolve jurisdictional or conflict of laws differences 
B  Activities to be undertaken by UNESCO 
The Experts Meeting on Cyberspace Law Proposes to the Director-General that UNESCO
undertake  inter alia  the following activities 
1  Pursue the on-going publication of the collective work on the  International
Dimensions of Cyberspace Law  
2  Study the application to cyberspace of each article of the Universal Declaration of
Human Rights 
3  Conduct an empirical study of the realities  significance and consequences of all
barriers to access  whether publicly or privately created  and in particular an
investigation of barriers to access  such as 
   The blocking of information and transactions due to practices of blacklisting
and barring from discussion groups 
   The use of filtering devices 
   The requirements of standardisation which may preclude information in nonstandardised
forms 
4  Assess the adequacy of translation software and take steps to increase the availability
and the development of improved versions 
5  Promote specific initiatives for the education of parents  children  teachers and other
Internet users on reading  writing and working in cyberspace  on the implications of
participation in cyberspace  and on the maximisation of the positive benefits
presented by the technologies 
6  Represent  in international debates on intellectual property law  all interests
concerned with the need to expand the public domain

Abstract
This contribution is aimed at elaborating an Internet Roadmap; specifically at improving inter-State Cyberspace relations  Cyber Defense proposals are included  Current technological state-of-the-art could allow for an Internet where freedom  privacy and security can exist together in a context where human rights are the main reference point  International organizations should acquire concepts and tools for a reasonable Cyberspace control in order to minimize Cyber Attacks and Cyber Espionage 
Introduction
Cyber Attacks (CA) could be included in  letter and spirit  of Article 51 of the United Nations (UN) Charter  Cyberspace (CS) has been recognized as a new domain in warfare but  currently  and also probably in the mid-term  without an international Cyber Defense (CD) agreement  unilateral  solutions  will most likely continue to unfortunately play a central role in the field of CD incidents (Uzal  2012) (Geiss & Lahmann  2013) 
The problem of CA attribution is a main challenge  both for state nations and for international organizations (Geiss & Lahmann  2013) 
Core topic  Detecting botnets and CA Command and Control (C&C) Servers  using Large Scale Net Flow Analysis (LSNFA) is feasible  both from technological and economic points of view  Successful detection rate is high and false positive rate is low  Pattern Recognition (PR) approach increases the effectiveness of LSNFA (Baieli  Cunha  Uzal  2014) 
It is demonstrated that for real-time detection of botnet and CA C&C Servers using LSNFA is possible  If international organizations like UN begin using LSNFA  the problem of CA and Cyber Espionage attribution could be successfully faced (Bilge et al  2012) (Brauckhoff et al  2009) (Claise  2004) (Cook  et al 2005)  
The ideal data source for Large Scale botnet and CA C&C Servers detection does not currently exist but there are alternatives data sources widely available such us Net Flow data (Bilge et al  2012) (Baieli  Cunha  Uzal 2014) (Uzal  Montejano  Riesco  2013 / 14) 
Current technological knowledge could allow for an Internet where freedom  privacy and security can exist together in a context where human rights are the main reference points  International organization cyberspace control could be executed without privacy rights violations 
Last but not least  we remark that concepts and tools described in this contribution could have an extra  value added   It could be an interesting approach to the use of LSNFA in the fight against money laundering specially with the alternative called Cyber Money Laundering – Cyber Gambling  being the most effective one  At the end  we propose the contribution conclusion and the contribution references 
State nations Cyber Attacks
Scholars accept that CA could be included both in letter and in spirit of Article 51 of the UN Charter  Experts also admit that a precise definition of  Armed Attack   within the Cyber context  is feasible to be agreed upon; however  problems come from the denominated  Problem of Attribution  
 Inter-State Cyber Security (Geiss  Lahmann  2013) has unfortunately been treated predominantly as a military issue and as a consequence debate has  by and large  revolved around the question of whether  and under which conditions  measures of self-defense pursuant to Article 51 of the Charter of the UN are feasible and permitted in response to CA   Referenced experts argue that   while self-defense certainly cannot be ruled out  the Problem of Attribution will preclude its proper application in many  if not most  instances (Geiss  Lahmann  2013) 
An international Cyber Defense agreement need
We point in advance that currently  and also likely in the mid-term  without an international CD agreement  unilateral remedies will most likely continue to play a central role in cases of CD incidents  We named as CD incident those CS conflicts where actors are state nations 
This contribution presents a proposal that complements the  traditional  unilateral focus based on Article 51 of UN Charter  Contribution presents technological aspects and new incumbencies / responsibilities to be faced by international organizations like UN / International Telecommunication Union or others to be discussed 
The technological aspect of this contribution is based on recent developments both in the field of Net Flow Analysis and in PR area of knowledge and applications  Detecting botnets and CA C&C Servers is a currently feasible task  Anyway  the use of presented technological focus makes sense only in the context of an ad hoc international CD agreement 
The problem of Cyber Attacks attribution
A precise definition of ‘Armed Attack  within the Cyber context is needed but  the most important challenge for the application of the doctrine of Self Defense (Article 51 of UN Charter) to the new  Cyber Weapons  is the attribution of  unlawful conduct  to the aggressor state nation 
The core of this contribution is giving fundamentals and tools to solve  The Attribution Problem  
Large Scale Net Flow Analysis and Pattern Recognition use
Currently it is possible to use large-scale  wide-area Botnet / CA C&C detection systems that incorporate a combination of techniques to overcome the challenges posed by the use of Net Flow
data  There are several groups of features that allow these systems to distinguish C&C channels from benign traffic using Net Flow records  To reduce these systems false positive rate  they incorporate a number of external reputation scores  Authors have developed evaluations that demonstrate that it is able to perform close to real-time detection of botnet and CA C&C Servers (Bilge et al  2012) (Baieli  Cunha  Uzal 2014) 
Tools based on these ideas work in two phases  A training phase where samples are used to build detection models  A detection phase where detection models are used to classify IP addresses as benign or associated with CA (Bilge et al  2012) (Baieli  Cunha  Uzal 2014)  PR concepts and tools are very useful in these schemes  It is understood that PR is the automated identification of shapes and others patterns  In this contribution context  PR is an important field of Computer Science concerned with recognizing patterns  particularly  in this case  Net Flow statistical histograms 
Freedom  privacy and security in Cyberspace
In the Introduction of this contribution we  in advance  remarked that current technology state could allow for an Internet where freedom  privacy and security can exist together in a context where human rights are the main reference point  International organization CS control could be executed without privacy rights violations  Recommended tools analyze just Net Flow statistical histograms  Private data will not be accessed  Freedom and privacy will be protected 
Extended  value added   Concepts and tools to fight against Cyber Money Laundering – Cyber Gambling
In the context of Argentina Council of Foreign Relations  authors have developed a seminar about Cyber Money Laundering – Cyber Gambling (Uzal  2013)  This seminar was replicated in Argentina s Army Polytechnical School (Escuela Superior Técnica del Ejército de Argentina) organized by Armed Forces Communications and Electronics Association  Seminars were successful 
Authors think that the use of LSNFA / PR in the fight against money laundering could be interesting  especially the alternative called Cyber Money Laundering – Cyber Gambling  as we anticipated in the Introduction  the most effective one 
Conclusions
Cyber Attacks can be included in  letter and spirit  of Article 51 of the UN Charter  Cyberspace has been recognized as a new domain in warfare 
Currently  and also probably in the mid-term  without an international Cyber Defense agreement  unilateral remedies will most likely continue to play a central role in the field of Cyber Defense incidents 
The problem of Cyber Attacks attribution is the main challenge 
Core topic  Detecting botnets and Cyber Attacks Command and Control Servers using Large Scale Net
Flow Analysis is feasible both from technological and economic point of view 
Researchers have demonstrated that it is feasible to perform close to real-time detection of botnet and Cyber Attacks C&C Servers using LSNFA  If international organizations like UN start using LSNFA  the problem of Cyber Attacks and Cyber Espionage attribution could be successfully faced 
The ideal data source for large-scale botnet and Cyber Attacks C&C Servers detection does not currently exist  there are  however  alternatives data source such us Net Flow data 
Current technology level could allow for an Internet where freedom  privacy and security can exist together in a context where human rights are the main reference point  International organizations
Cyberspace control could be executed without privacy rights violations 
It could be also an interesting approach to the use of Large Scale Net Flow Analysis / Pattern Recognition in the fight against money laundering specially with the alternative called Cyber Money Laundering – Cyber Gambling  being the most effective one

Can Trade Policy Set Information Free 
 
A Project Funded by the MacArthur and Ford Foundations  with additional support from the Minerva Research Program
Susan Ariel Aaronson  with Miles D  Townes
Background 
Although the internet is creating a virtuous circle of expanding global growth  opportunity  and information flows  policymakers and market actors are taking steps that undermine access to information  reduce freedom of expression and splinter the internet  Almost every country has adopted policies to protect privacy  enforce intellectual property rights  protect national security  or thwart cyber-theft  hacking  and spam  While these actions may be necessary to achieve important policy goals  these policies may distort cross-border information flows and trade  Meanwhile  US  Canadian and European firms provide much of the infrastructure as well as censor-ware or blocking services to their home governments and repressive states such as Iran  Russia  and China  As a result  although the internet has become a platform for trade  trade itself and trade policies have served both to enhance and undermine both internet freedom and an open internet  This policy brief shows how governments have used trade policies to regulate the Internet and we make suggestions on how to ensure that trade policy enhances internet freedom  openness and stability  Due to limited funding  we could only examine US  EU and Canadian trade and internet policies  but we hope to examine other countries in the future    
 
Trade agreements as internet governance
Trade agreements and policies have become an important source of rules governing cross-border information flows 
Policymakers recognize that when we travel the information superhighway  we are often trading – and internet usage can dramatically expand trade 
The internet is not only a tool of empowerment for the world s people  but a major source of wealth for US  EU  and Canadian business 
Moreover  internet commerce will grow substantially in the future as much of the world s population is not yet online  US  European and Canadian policymakers want to both protect their firms  competitiveness and increase market share   US  European and Canadian governments understand that while some domestic laws can have global reach  domestic laws on copyright  piracy  and internet security do not have global legitimacy and force  Hence  they recognize they must find common ground on internationally accepted rules governing cross-border data flows 
The WTO
In theory  the WTO should be an appropriate venue for such discussions  WTO members agreed not to place tariffs on data flows  In addition  the WTO s dispute settlement body has settled two trade disputes related to internet issues  internet gambling and China s state trading rights on audiovisual products and services (WTO 2007  WTO 2012)  However  the member states have not found common ground on how to reduce new trade barriers to information flows  In 2011  several nations stopped a US and EU proposal that members agree not to block internet service providers or impede the free flow of information online  Moreover  the members of the WTO have made little progress on adding new regulatory issues such as privacy and cyber security that challenge internet policymakers  However  many new online activities will require cooperative global regulation on issues that transcend market access – the traditional turf of the WTO  These issues will require policymakers to think less about ensuring that their model of regulation is adopted globally but more about achieving interoperability among different governance approaches  Alas  policymakers are not consistently collaborating to achieve interoperability 
Trade giants and the internet
In a recent policy brief (Aaronson and Townes 2012)  Miles Townes and I examined how the US  the EU  and Canada use trade policies to govern the internet at home and across borders  We found the three trade giants use bilateral and regional trade agreements to encourage e-commerce  reduce online barriers to trade  and to develop shared policies in a world where technology is rapidly changing and where governments compete to disseminate their regulatory approaches  Policymakers also use export controls  trade bans or targeted sanctions to protect internet users in other countries or to prevent officials of other countries from using internet related technologies in ways that undermine the rights of individuals abroad  Finally  policymakers may use trade agreements to challenge other governments  online rules and policies as trade barriers  We discuss how these policies  agreements  bans and strategies could affect internet openness  internet governance  and internet freedom 
Table 1 Case study Free Trade Agreements  Provisions that can enhance (+) or reduce (-) internet openness
 
Findings
·         The Internet is transforming trade policy  Policymakers in the US  EU  and Canada want to advance the free flow of information  but lack consensus on how to balance Internet openness (policies and procedures that allow netizens to make their own choices about services and content to create or share) and Internet stability (policies to prevent hacking and piracy  as well as policies to protect privacy and security) 
·         The US is actively pushing for binding provisions in trade agreements to advance the free flow of information while challenging other nations  privacy and server location policies as trade barriers 
·         Trade policies lag trade realities  and the norms of the Internet (speed  transparency  and responsiveness) have not yet fully penetrated policymaking  Policymakers make Internet policies in bureaucratic silos of intellectual property rights (IPR)  privacy  etc    without weighing the collective effects on Inter- net openness or Internet freedom  Officials do not coordinate policies to promote the free flow of information with policies to advance Internet freedom 
·          While officials in the three case studies are responsive to their constituents  they have not figured out how to negotiate trade agreements in a way that accommodates the need for secrecy as well as meets public expectations for transparency 
·          US  EU  and to a lesser extent Canadian policymakers have made expanding Internet freedom a foreign policy goal  but they have not consistently collaborated or addressed the global spillovers of national web censorship 
·          The US  EU  and Canada have worked internationally to develop principles to ensure an open and stable Internet  but these principles are neither universal nor enforceable   Governments and netizens in the US  EU  and Canada agree that Internet openness and freedom are important goals  However  they have not clearly defined these terms or developed principles for the proper role of government in balancing Internet freedom and stability at the domestic and global levels 
·         Policymakers don t know if censorship is a barrier to trade  The US and EU have issued reports describing other countries  Internet policies (privacy  censorship  server location and security policies) as potential barriers to trade  None of the three governments has yet challenged Internet restrictions as a barrier to trade 
 
 
Recommendations  
·         Policymakers cannot sustain the Open Internet by relying solely on rules that advance the free flow of information  As trade agreements have long addressed governance  the US and other governments negotiating binding provisions to encourage cross-border information flows should also include language related to the regulatory context in which the Internet functions  free expression  fair use  rule of law  and due process  Thus  the US  EU and Canada should show their commitment to Internet openness by annually reporting when and why they blocked specific applications or technologies and/or limited content (or asked intermediaries to limit access) to sites or domains  With this information  policymakers may get better understanding of how to achieve a flexible and effective balance of Internet stability and Internet openness 
·          Policymakers may need to develop shared principles for maintaining the One Global Internet and to delineate steps to take when countries do not live up to these principles 
·          Trade policymakers should ask the WTO Secretariat to analyze if domestic policies that restrict information (short of exceptions for national security or public morals) are also barriers to cross-border information flows which can be challenged in a trade dispute  Moreover  policymakers should develop strategies to quantify how such policies affect trade flows 
·          WTO member states should use the trade policy review process to discuss the trade implications of member state Internet regulations that can distort trade 
·         The three trade giants  use of bilateral/regional trade agreements with diverse Internet/e-commerce provisions may  without deliberate intent  gradually fragment the web  Given that countries have different priorities for privacy  free speech  national security  etc    which make international harmonization of strategies to advance the open Internet unlikely  Thus  when they negotiate bilateral  regional or multilateral trade agreements  policymakers should use language to encourage interoperability among signatories  privacy  online piracy  and security policies

  The Meeting which shall be held in Sao Paulo  must offers some of basic principles to build good environment for Internet Governance for all stakeholder in the world taking in Consideration the freedom for expression  opinion and equal of the accessibility for all stakeholder  When she addressed the United Nations General Assembly on 24 September 2013  Dilma Rousseff  President of Brazil  reminded us that  In the absence of the right to privacy  there can be no true freedom of expression and opinion and therefore no effective democracy   

 

 Therefore  the human right for all people  in the internet must be protected and secure  so that everyone can feeling secure and able to express about his opinion in easy way 

 

It s very important for the Democratically in the third world to find the right way to forward   so it need help  because it s in the early stage of freedom and democracy 

 

Below is my principles 

 

1 - Freedom of expression  privacy  security of the individual and respect for human rights  equality in judgment and respect the nationality of the people 

 

2 - respect for human values   and the general guideline principles of citizenship and ethnic diversity and the advancement of society to achieve prosperity and a decent living  

 

3 - provide opportunities for training   education  transparency and equality among peoples of the world of non- discrimination in terms of gender or race 

 

4 - do not block the Internet or restricting the conscious country in the world under the pretext of the economic sanctions imposed by developed countries that limit development and scientific progress using the Internet   which has become an effective tool in the development of the country 

 

5 - Governments must not put restrictions on the creativity of its citizens were estimated and  non- discrimination and gather information that will limit the number of Internet users on the basis of the privacy interests of the state and the impact on confidence in the security of the internet 

 

6 - on all States to establish laws to protect the children from the dangers of internet and trafficking in human beings and that must be a deterrent  

 

7 - Freedom of the electronic press is part of the human rights and should be protected by the governments and governments of developing countries need to protect freedom of the press  bloggers and websites  must promote openness   transparency    accountability and should be based on respect for the rule of law in the country 

 

8 - Do not involve politics in the work of organizations and management of the Internet and control them in any argument which is contrary to the rules and Principles of human rights and international conventions 

 

9 - Make the Internet for all  a safe place and open accommodate everyone without exception

ABSTRACT
This contribution highlights the Roadmap for the Further Evolution of the Internet Governance Ecosystem  This roadmap is well represented by the growing need to internationalize the current Internet process of governance  The following paper notes how legitimacy is tied to the safeguarding of the human being and respecting his or hers innate dignity  under clear and already established principles enshrined in the universal principles of human rights 
Human Rights as Essential Parts of the Internet Governance Ecosystem  Contribution to Netmundial
March 4  2014
Professors Roy Balleste  J S D  and Joanna Kulesza  Ph D  appreciate the opportunity to share observations with the Global Multistakeholder Meeting on the Future of Internet Governance and respectfully submit this contribution  We thank the Brazilian government  the Brazilian Internet Steering Committee  and the 1net Initiative organizers for the opportunity to contribute to the global internet governance dialogue  This contribution highlights the Roadmap for the Further Evolution of the Internet Governance Ecosystem  This roadmap is well represented by the growing need to internationalize the current Internet process of governance  We note that the effective management of the Internet needs to be protected within a meaningful participatory process because of the multilayered architecture of the network requiring equal participation of various stakeholders  The process  however  must gain legitimacy by safeguarding the human being and respecting his or hers innate dignity  under clear and already established principles enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the human rights system accompanying it  including numerous treaties and the rich body of customary and soft law 
Although there has always been governance from the very beginning of the Internet  today it seems that this governance is experiencing another major step in its evolution  Any participant in the Internet governance process must recognize that this governance works not as a top-down power relationship  or an attempt to equate it with  control   but rather as a bottom-up approach that creates a sustainable relationship among stakeholders  One will also note that inclusive governance is further clarified by the language of the WSIS Tunis Agenda for the Information Society (paragraph 35) where it is stated that governance  encompasses both technical and public policy issues and should involve all stakeholders   In the other hand  most individuals assume that the ecosystem has proper safeguards to protect human rights both offline and online 
Unfortunately  human rights all too often represent a secondary consideration in the online
world  giving way to reasons of state security and the economic interest of states  influential
lobbies or multinational corporations  The debate on human rights obligations of non-state actors
and the effectiveness of executing states  obligations in that domain gains momentum when
confronted with the cyberrealm  As noted recently by the UN Human Rights Council  the same
rights that people have offline must also be protected online  while acknowledging  the global
and open nature of the Internet as a driving force in accelerating progress towards development
in its various forms   The UN Human Rights Council Resolution on the promotion  protection
and enjoyment of human rights on the Internet calls upon states  to promote and facilitate access
to the Internet and international cooperation  with the perspective of safeguarding human rights 
There are policy concerns to be found in the threats to freedom of access to information 
openness  and the dangers that accompany over-restrictive governance of the Internet  In these
cases  management of the Internet could become detrimental to the world community  The
critical element—cooperation—is unambiguous and straightforward  It is rooted in the language
of the Charter of the United Nations  which states as its purpose the achievement of international
cooperation in the resolution of international problems  and in the promotion of respect for
human rights and fundamental freedoms for all  It is also rooted in the language of the Tunis
Agenda  where the concept of  cooperation  is used in 32 places  In particular  the Tunis Agenda
supports regional and international integration efforts aimed at building the Information Society 
reiterating  strong cooperation within and among regions  to support knowledge-sharing 
International cooperation is also an element of the principles of sustainable development and
good neighborliness which are well established in international law  States  unlike other Internet
governance stakeholders  have therefore an international law obligation to engage in
multinational cooperation in good faith and with the aim of achieving effective results  This
obligation exists also when it comes to the positive responsibility of states to protect individuals
within their jurisdiction from any human rights abuses  also ones originating from third parties 
private or governmental  International cooperation is therefore instrumental to identifying the
ways and means for effective human rights protection online  an aim all states are legally
obligated to pursue  This intergovernmental cooperation must be exercised also in the
multistakeholder environment of the Internet governance ecosystem  recognizing the various
actors and their roles  States therefore must revise their position and rather than  control  the
network  they ought to stimulate the multistakeholder dialogue among the various actors 
Therefore we support the fundamental principles delineated by the United States government that
 existing multistakeholder institutions deserve significant credit  within the Internet governance
ecosystem  We further note that instead of replacing existing mechanisms or institutions  the
evolution should build on the existing structures of governance  with further discussion at the
IGF and other fora  Since 1998  ICANN has supported a positive multistakeholder process  Its
substitution by a different multilateral system does not seem the feasible solution  although all
attempts to add transparency to its processes and decision making are welcome 
Thus  if we are to support the evolution of the Multistakeholder Internet Governance Ecosystem 
then we must recognize that any model of Internet governance devoid of international
stewardship will fail  The goal  therefore  should be governance of cyberspace that involves
international stewardship  and a social contract that simultaneously promotes the concept of
human dignity as basis for all human rights  There is no doubt that the human person requires freedom and democracy to achieve a dignified life  The Internet governance ecosystem must protect inclusiveness in order to remain legitimate  The opportunity to participate in the process has the potential to recognize the realities of online citizens and avoid the exclusion of regular users from decisions that affect their daily lives 
Along the way  we discover the origins of the Internet  its geo-political structures  the fundamentals of human rights  the stakeholders in the debate  and a potential governance model that could aim at benefiting humanity s social process by helping to fulfill the human needs and desires of the Information Society  reformatting and adjusting our fundamental social contract to the Internet age  The Internet has the potential to be a democratizing influence  but only if this future ecosystem includes respect for human rights  It is for these reasons that all stakeholders must take steps to assure users that the decisions made for their benefit  are indeed carried out for that purpose  This goal is not too difficult to reach  deriving individual rights and obligations for the online environment may be done without too much effort by applying the existing rich body of international human rights law to this new context  Numerous such attempts have been successfully undertaken by various civil society groups in recent years  States and multinational corporations alike may benefit directly from their experiences 
A legal framework of the Internet governance ecosystem may become a tangible solution; a legacy of lasting cooperation that supports the goals of a globalized Internet  The members of the Internet governance ecosystem should dare to aim higher  Ultimately  a workable model must be sustainable  durable  enforceable  and grounded in a bottom-up process involving the participation of all stakeholders with oversight over the future of the Internet  It is up to us to take action  the stakeholders of cyberspace and members of the Information Society  with states acting as shepherds for this new model of global online democracy

The University of Gezira submits the following contribution a roadmap Topics  Cybercrime  children  the youth and Special Needs  

 

Over time  increases cybercrime and multiplied its forms not only to break into networks and steal information or sabotage them only  but also appeared moral crimes such as kidnapping  extortion   murder and others 

 

In light of the tremendous advances of information technology   and because of the sheer number of individuals and institutions who attend this network   it has become easy to commit the most heinous crimes against their visitors  whether they are individuals or institutions or entire communities of the province 

 

This prompted many organizations and bodies to launch calls and warnings of the danger of this phenomenon that threatens all Internet users where it became easier means in front of the perpetrators of the crime   so he went criminals who violate the symptoms  and control of the children easily  in addition to committing the crimes of libel and defamation through websites dedicated to this goal 

 

The internet crime is become very dangerous for Continuity of internet and it's effect in the trade  education  telecommunications in risk   The cyber attacked made the internet very dangerous place for communications  so we need safe internet environment  without any kind of threat which it will effect negatively for international trade and exchange of transfer  of the money in the world  Another kind of the internet crime which is crime against children (is very important crime)  because children is the future of the world  and any country need good children  well-educated and ready to develop his country which is  reflected positive to his country especially and generally to the world   so we need to protect them from this kind of crime  We need to establish Legislation and laws  consistent with the Child Rights Act  which was approved by the UN 

 

The most important issues is to enable young people (Youth) to use the mechanics of the Internet so that they can express their views without fear or terror or control and criminal prosecution   prompting the development and advancement of the country as the young people (youth)  are the fuel in the home construction and sustainable development and evolution and sophistication  Must involve all stakeholders to work together to contain the young people and enable them to make decisions on the Internet 

 

Another issue that must be taken care of a special needs who are suffering many problems and must engage them in dialogues of Global Forum on Internet Governance so that they can give their views and how to explain their position and meet the needs of their own in the governance of the Internet and taken into account in order to be an active force in the international community   this is the simplest we have rights and part of human rights  

 

Ultimately  the Internet s global Multistakeholder community should work cooperatively on continuing to improve and evolve the Internet governance system for freedom for youth and more protection for children from the dangers of internet and take in consideration the special needs  The more open and inclusive the approach  the greater the legitimacy the system will have 

 

The university of Gezira  Sudan believes that existing Multistakeholder institutions deserve significant credit for the Internet s global growth and dynamism and should remain the cornerstones of the Internet governance system  proper incentives and environment are in place domestically so that a single  interoperable Internet can flourish globally  enabling freedom of expression and economic prosperity

1 Introduction

 

The education and technology area in Brazil consists of teachers  researchers  educational institutions administrators and policy makers concerned about the evolution of teaching and learning in the age of the internet  A number of institutions addresses this topic  directly or relating it to other issues or periodical events such as congresses or meetings  However  there isn't an unified voice of those professionals regarding the roadmap for further evolution of the internet governance ecosystem  Let alone the acknowledgment and assurance of the Internet Governance principles  The purpose of this content is to re-examine Brazilian publications about education and technology and indicate some paths for innovative teaching and learning  This research originated in Catholic University of São Paulo Post-Graduate Program in Education  Curriculum  in the context of thesis within the field of Web Curriculum  a new concept about teaching with the internet and a biannual seminar which has already gathered over 800 publications on the subject 

 

The execution of the Seminars Web Curriculum in Catholic University of São Paulo Brazil (PUC-SP) was accompanied by many discussions about pedagogical practices with technologies integrated with the curriculum  The educators which have accompanied the issues related to technology have recognized the need for more availability of information  Texts and interviews such as in podcasts (audio conversations) done for the Blog Web Curriculum  and the proceedings with the scientific articles which were presented in the events  help bring back some of this universe 

 

The methodology for selection of data and analysis of the results used interviews and analysis of the content going beyond documentary data (blog and articles associated with I and II Web Curriculum)  It is possible to see also a panoramic view of the incorporation of technologies in the pedagogical practices  with a view which examines more the Web 2 0  In order to make it possible to draw this research trajectory  it was done a process of identification of documented practices in articles  analyzed in national databases which had records of other events about the theme of the technology use in education  what resulted in the development of a matrix of categories  which ended up serving as a support to identifying the use of technology in education  in a perspective of innovation in the curriculum  integrating Web 2 0  systemized scientifical knowledge and the experiencies which students bring from their life and context 

 

As a result of previous interviews with specialists and readings of scientific literature (SAVIANI  1992; FREIRE  1996; LITWIN  1997; ALMEIDA  2000; PRADO  2003; ALMEIDA  VALENTE  2007; ALMEIDA  SILVA  2011)  this investigation came to some concepts of Innovative Trends  Innovation and Innovative Practices in Education  In order to perform the analysis and interpretation of the data  the option taken was to use the software CHIC (Cohesive Implied Hierarchical Classification) with the goal to build categories which could verify the existence of innovative practices in the proceedings of I and II Seminars Web Curriculum and also in the blog Web Curriculum 

 

 
2 The software CHIC – Cohesive implied hierarchical classification

 

The software CHIC – Cohesive Implied Hierarchical Classification was developed by Régis Grass  professor at the Polytechnical School at Nantes University and brought to Brazil by professor Saddo Almouloud  from the Departament of Mathematics of the Center of Mathematical  Physical and Technological Sciences at Catholic University of São Paulo  This software  according to Moraes and Valente (2008)  extracts from a set of data  rules of association between variables  crossing subjects and variables to provide an index of quality of association and represents an structure of the variables obttained by means of these rules offering as a result a directory-strucure shaped in the for a tree of similarities  a tree of cohesiveness and a graphical representation of implications 

 

In order to execute the analysis and interpretation of the data for this work  the option to use the software CHIC had in mind the goal of building categories which could evidentiate the existence of innovative practices in the proceedings of the I and II Seminars Web Curriculum and also in the Blog Web Curriculum  It is important to remind that there is no software that can act as the solution to every need of the data analysis but CHIC presented itself as a reasonably viable choice 

 

With the goal to obtain results coherent with the field studied  an option was made to divide the research in four phases  the first occurred between May and September of 2008  moment in which there was the planning and execution of the I Seminar Web Curriculum  The second phase started in July 2008 finishing at May 2010  The strategy used in this phase was the analysis of content which ended up being need for a deeper comprehension of the observations in the blog Web Curriculum  The third phase started in July 2010 and ended right after the II Seminar Web Curriculum  initiating then the fourth and last phase  when was done a content analysis of the blog soon after the execution of the second seminar  once that the blog Web Curriculum remained active 

 

Given the trajectory presented  the study of what was to be analyzed in this work was limited to four objects which are  the proceedings of the two versions of the seminars Web Curriculum and the two periods of posts on the blog after the I Web Curriculum and after the II Web Curriculum  The data obtained in the preliminary phase served as a theoretical support for the concepts of innovation  innovative practices etc 

 

The procedure of analysis with CHIC has developed through some main processes  The first was the mapping of the items to be analyzed in the specific case of this research  a spreadsheet was used to register all the texts with their keywords to be analyzed (articles from both seminars) and presented by their authors (such keywords referred to web 2 0 tools  softwares  applications and also concepts) 

 

After this initial mapping in a spreadsheet  the archive in comma separated values was transported into the CHIC program and then there was the generation of trees of similarities  which show the convergences and divergences between the texts and the practices analyzed  To every greater group of branches in the tree of similiarities the name class was given and the smaller groups represented in the tree-shaped graphic  the name subclass was given 

 

The analysis of classes in the similarities tree generated by CHIC resulted in the indication of convergence between practices of integration of technologies in the curriculum  all within the scope of the concept Web Curriculum  The analysis evidentiates  also  the trends for innovative practices which could be found in all the material presented in the seminars Web Curriculum and also in the event blog 

 

The categories are of great value in the data analysis  once that  the information basis used is well varied  which makes it harder and maybe even near impossible to obtain results  It is important to remember also that the categories are objective and are related with each other  According to Prado (2003)  the category summarizes a whole of ideas expressed in the texts analyzed and which where identified from the interpretative analysis of the records 

 

 
3 Procedures of analysis with CHIC

 

To perform the data analysis  at first there was the attribution of codes to all the elements of content identified as significative given the theoretical basis and goals of the current research  To every element of content an identification code was attributed and the list of elements formed the first column of the spreadsheet which generated the tree of similarities at CHIC 

 

The procedure was done in the same manner with the oral presentations  posters and case studies located in the proceedings of the I and II Seminars Web Curriculum  The article which were presented as oral presentation were given a code with the preffix  comum  (as inspired by the word communication) and to those that were presented as poster was given a code with the preffix  poster   The final of the code was a simple numbering pattern inherited from the article analyzed  therefore the name of an article was replaced  for example  by  comum_011  in the spreadsheet for analysis  The heading of the spreadsheet which generated the tree of similarities of CHIC was filled with the keywords found in the content 

 

The spreadsheet was then built and divided in sections  including the content of the proceedings of 2008  according to the timeline of events presented 

 

<See attached picture 1-chic-analysis-procedure>

 

The keywords were chosen based on the use of web tools in the classroom  since the investigation of practices guided the discussion of the concepts which generated the trends for an innovative education  There was the execution of a process of finding synonims to avoid repetition of keywords  Terms such as "videoconferencia" and "flashmeeting"  being the last the name of type of videoconferencing tool  were grouped in only one column named videoconference (abbreviation videoconf ) in such a way that there was a reduction of keywords and enable visibility of the similarities between determinate practices 

 

A process of filtering the keywords was also performed to remove words which weren't directly connected to practices of the use of the web in education 

 

The next step was executing the time division with the goal to try to create a timeline aiming to identify the practices of the use of the web in education through time  considering the two periods of the seminar 

 

The tree of similarities produced by CHIC is the result of convergences and divergences of the words encoded initially for the construction of the spreadsheet  complemented by the software through means of data processing and accompanying the execution of the analysis which were made by the researchers 

 

The similarity coefficient can be obtained through a specific screen of the software CHIC and it is the numerical representation of the relationship attributed between two or more variables  which in this case are the keywords  The stronger relationships can be visualized in the graphical form of the tree of similarities also through a red emphasis in the line of the graph  The general view of those analysis indicates the panorama of the practices of integrating technologies into the curriculum and the innovative trends found 
 
 
4 Analysis of the proceedings of the I Seminar Web Curriculum – CHIC

 

 

In the creation by CHIC of the tree of similarities of the 2008 proceedings of the I Seminar Web Curriculum  one could notice several knots and forkings  The closest a knot was to another  it resulted in closeness of a set of terms  indicating greater similarity  However  one could consider in the analysis also knots without the red line for emphasys of relevance  considering the meaning of the relationship for the context at hand  in accordance with the interpretation of the researchers 

 

<See picture 2-web-curriculum-2008-event-publications-page>

 

One of the strongest relationships in the tree of similarities was between the articles identified with the keywords  audio-podcast  and  concept-mapping  

 

Another important relationship which appears in the tree of similarities in the proceedings of 2008 is the one which relates virtual learning environments such as Moodle with web ICT tools such as videoconference  This class was named as  new characteristics of virtual learning environments   The keywords  vc-fm  and  moodle  relate each other with  chat  and  forum  showing practices in learning environments 

 

It is interesting to notice that the coexistence of tools as virtual learning environment (VLE) such as Moodle and other more technically complex such as the videoconference shows an important path of enhancing the possibilities of a VLE 

 

The third relationship very strong in the tree of similarities has brought other four technologies which were indicated in the works of the I Seminar Web Curriculum   blog    wiki    video  and  photos   This class can be named as  multimedia publishing online  

 

The relationship is notably strong between the doubles of elements or subclasses  blog    wiki    video  and  photos   indicating that the multimedia content (video and photos) is inserted in determinate moments of online publishing (blog and wiki)  in the pedagogical practices with technology 

 

Another important relationship is evidently meaningful for the investigation in focus  The class relates  research  and  internet  with greater similarity  with the red line for emphasys  and relates the pair with  laptops   The name of this class was  research with educational laptops  

 

The class  research with educational laptops  brings together articles from researchers which have brought experiences of the use of the web in the classroom with educational laptops  The pedagogical work with portable computers was done with the use of strategies such as internet research and the creation of blogs aiming the production of knowledge and collaboration 

 

The general analysis of the works of the I Seminar Web Curriculum shows some interesting characteristics in regards to the researchers' practice for the integration of technologies in the curriculum in the year of 2008 such as  documentation of practices in audio; new characteristics of virtual learning environments; multimedia online publishing and research with educational laptops 

 

These characteristics of the use of technologies in education have been brought from the works of 2008 and are the beginning of a full picture about the trends in innovation in integrating technologies in the curriculum  We will see  on the forthcoming analysis  the next parts of this picture which will complete the panorama of trends in innovation 
 
 
5 Analysis of the proceedings of the II Seminar Web Curriculum – CHIC

 

<See picture 3-web-curriculum-2010-biannual-event-page>

 

The tree of similarities of the proceedings of the II Seminar Web Curriculum brings some of the themes similar to those of the I Seminar Web Curriculum  There can also be perceived selected themes in terms of similarity such as in  youtube  and  social-media  

 

The proximity between  youtube  and  social-media  brings an aspect very meaningful when analyzing the use of social media in education  The pedagogical practices with social media have intensified and the teachers researchers have related it to the publication of online content  in this case  video 

 

The class  interconnection between social media and online content  brings the relationship established in articles between the use of social media and the publication of multimedia content  specially video in Youtube  The investigation of social media is based on content produced and selected by students and teachers  as online videos  and the pedagogical work is built starting with this content 

 

Another class which also is evident in the analysis by CHIC in the proceedings of the II Seminar is the one that relates  GoogleDrive  and  moodle   The class indicated was named  Virtual learning environment and Web 2 0 tools   Moodle  a virtual learning environment which is one of the most used  is even more complemented by external tools characteristic of the Web 2 0  such as GoogleDrive 

 

Virtual learning environments are being considered with new possibilities by the researchers in reference to the association of Web 2 0 interfaces and the articles which contain these keywords confirm the concreteness of a trend which begun to happen in the I Seminar and in the II Seminar already indicate the occurrence of these changes  The type of learning virtual environment more present in the articles in the platform Moodle 

 

The tree of similarities resulting from the analysis of the scientifical production of the proceedings of the II Seminar Web Curriculum indicated a class which related concepts that point out to one of the contemporary concerns of the researchers  The terms  mobile-devices  and  hypermedia-hypertext  have brought articles which show the possibilities for education of mobile computational devices such as educational laptops and tablets  having in mind the use of the web through links or hypermedia 

 

The traditional analysis of more than one broad class converges with the findings described before  The additional class includes the subclasses  youtube  and  social-media  complemented in the tree of similarities by  twitter    blog  and  fotos  

 

The class brings back interesting aspects of the analysis such as  interconnection between social media and online content  and  virtual learning environments and Web 2 0 tools   These aspects are presented in the studies which show the need of the expanded classroom the one in which learning happens beyond the physical space  and even so  of the learning environment designated by the institution  integrating the social media and other tools of the web 

 

The publications of the proceedings of the II Seminar Web Curriculum have shown even more paths for the integration of technology in the curriculum which complement those shown in the edition of the seminar of two years before  The classes found in the analysis reflect some of the categories of the use of the web in education such as  interconnection between social media and online content; virtual learning environments and Web 2 0 tools; Mobile devices and the use of the web and the use of the web for media production 
 
 
6 Analysis of the blog Web Curriculum with the use of CHIC

 

<See PDF 4-blog-webcurriculum>

 

The first time period of the blog covers the text published since its origin in May 2008  passing through the time of the first seminar in June 2008  until before the second seminar  in June 2010 

 

The tree of similarities of the blog until the period before the II Seminar Web Curriculum showed most of the terms which also could be seen in the tree which brings the analysis of the proceedings of the I Seminar Web Curriculum  However  in this tree of similarities there is an order of alignments different than the connections between the branches and we have also pointed out some of these classes which bring terms with a greater relationship 

 

The terms in the tree of similarities of the blog differentiate by referring texts which also bring themes of the events online or lectures organized by the research group which happened in between both seminars  In the first class analyzed there are already terms related to these online events such as  site-portal    chat  and  twitter   This class was named  online publication in twitter and sites  

 

The relationship  online publication in twitter and sites  brings similarities between terms which indicate a progressive change in the online publication of discussions about the integration of technologies in the curriculum  having as scenario the events online themselves involving the research group responsible for Web Curriculum 

 

The class  online publication in sites and twitter  shows  therefore  that the meetings between researchers can be complemented and made more dynamic with the materials and online comment exchange in spaces such as educational sites with links in the blog Web Currículo and in the Twitter which accompanies it  This type of publication intensified from 2008 to 2010 to the point of meaning a whole new group of headlining program which happened in the online events 

 

Another class which also related online events which investigated themes of the Seminars Web Curriculum  such as  social-media  and  augmented-reality   This class was named  investigation of themes such as social media and augmented reality   The class unites the terms "augmented-reality" and "social-media"  since these were part of the online events with researchers which participated in the Seminar Web Curriculum 

 

Another class evidentiated in the tree of similarities which analyzed the posts of the first period of the blog Web Curriculum pointed out onlline events  The class which related the terms  second-life  and  streaming  was named  live participation on distance learning online events about education and technology  

 

This class originated from the similarity of texts of the blog Web Curriculum which bring back debates occurred online with the participation of internet users from several parts of Brazil and of the world  Watching and participating in the video debates or in virtual worlds aren't activities restricted to the online events with researchers  but also they have been found in the everyday of teachers' practices which also do research  This can be inferred from the next class which is evident in the tree of similarities of CHIC  which relates the terms  media  and  laptops   This class was named  activities with media in educational laptops  

 

The relationship between "media" and "laptops" brings texts about the events of the Seminar Web Curriculum and also about productions of researchers of the group at PUC-SP  The studies of researchers are documented in the blog Web Curriculum  for the identification of new themes of investigation and research trends 

 

The analysis of the first period of texts in the blog Web Curriculum shows a face of the investigation about the integration of technology in the curriculum which still is only at the beginning in the scientific writings by the researchers  one which unites the experimentation and the scientifical observation  The everyday practices  in scientific events and in the classroom  have privileged the experimentation and enlarged the frontiers in the current use of technologies  The classes analyzed have shown aspects such as  online publication in sites and twitter  investigação of themes such as social media and augmented reality  participation in live distance learning events on online debates about education and technology  activities with the integration of media in educational laptops 

 

In general  the analysis of the first periodo of the blog Web Curriculum has brought aspects important in the integration of technology in the curriculum  since it has shown the collaboration that the web can bring into the debate  Being it through the video broadcast  social media or publication in blogs  the web may add and enhance the discussions of researchers and promote the construction of knowledge 

 

In the second period of the analysis of the blog Web Curriculum  begins with the II Seminar  one can notice even more the varied quantity of terms which bring pedagogical practices with the use of technologies  including characteristics of the Web 2 0 

 

The first class analyzed relates the terms  blog  with the double  video  and  mobile-devices  and also the term  twitter   In this class can be found the relationship between several texts of the blog which bring the event videos  It is interesting to notice that the site that hosts and produces the videos acquires a new context when related to the practices such as mobile computation and the use of social media such as twitter  Therefore  we have called this class  mobile devices and multimedia production  

 

The relationship between multimedia productions and the blog goes beyond merely hosting the content  When inviting to see the video through social media  it is implied the invite to follow or receive more news about the blog Web Curriculum through email  having access to more productions of the online profile of Web Curriculum 

 

A class which relates the terms  podcast  and  social-media  to the term  distance-learning  is evident in the blog analysis  It is about the texts which mention audio productions in the area of education and technology which are constant in the virtual learning environments of distance learning and are also disseminated through social media 

 

The texts related in this analysis bring podcast  proposal of learning through virtual environments and articles of researchers in reviews about the theme distance learning and teachers' professional training  Therefore  the online audio production is linked to practices of teaching and learning and contextualized in the investigation of the technologies integrated with the curriculum 

 

The analysis of an additional class helps to map and review the categories found  The class which unites  site    GoogleDrive  and  laptops  brings the extra pontuaction about the texts of the second period of analysis of the blog 

 

The classes indicated in this analysis brings elements related to online publication  the authorship of multimedia content and the practice of online education  They are  multimedia production and mobile devices and podcasts and learning 

 

The analysis of the second period of the blog Web Curriculum has brought important indications about the integration of technologies in the curriculum with the use of the web  The multimedia records and the learning environments have been some of the focuses of the actions of teachers researchers connected to the theme of investigation  As a trend for the education and technology  these actions of the use of the web must be intensified and collaborate for learning in several different spaces 

 

 
7 Final remarks

 

The analysis of the works and the online texts which accompany the I and II Seminar Web Curriculum PUC-SP  in the years of 2008 and 2011  had as a goal to identify characteristics of innovative practices in what refers to the integration of technologies in the curriculum  In the process of analysis of the publications of the Seminars Web Curriculum there was the construction of categories to help in the identification of trends for innovative practices  The study of the blog Web Curriculum has brought publications related to the themes referred between the works of the integrants of the research group in technologies in education  enabling to identify elements of the innovative use of technologies in education 

 

The qualitative methodology of data selection and analysis of the results done with the software CHIC was complemented by the analysis of content to the data  leading to examine several evidences  beyond the paths found in the categories indicated  The results of this investigation were the identification of characteristics of innovative practices in what is referred the integration of the technologies into the curriculum  a panorama of the publications of the I and II Seminars Web Curriculum and the indication of categories to help on the mapping of trends for innovative practices 

 

This is one of many experiences to integrate technologies in the curriculum and be conscious about internet governance principle in the space of schools and other educational institutions  Currently  Web Curriculum continues to produce biannual events  such as the 2012 and the 2014 (in preparation) and is the focus of publications by the researcher editor of the blog Renata Aquino Ribeiro  who participated on the Internet Forum of Brazil in Belém and events in CGI Brazil  The effort now is to continue the research in the area and the participation of the research group

One of the future steps that this research has inspired  is the idea that the unfinished is also a part of the search for the best practice  There is never an end to the search to do more  want more in the everyday of the educator who seeks to integrate technologies in the curriculum  It is the movement of searching  unrestful and unsettling  which makes the analysis of the strategies for the use of education to perfect itself always

Economic embargo on countries provoked devastating effects to the economy  to education and technical and scientific progress 

 

Some sanctions imposed by the United States government are 

    1  No arms-related exports
    2  Controls over dual-use exports
    3  Restrictions on economic assistance
    4  Financial restrictions 
    4 a Requiring the United States to oppose loans by the World Bank and other international financial institutions 
    4 b Diplomatic immunity waived to allow families of terrorist victims to file for civil damages in U S  courts 
    4 c Tax credits for companies and individuals denied for income earned in listed countries 
    4 d Duty-free goods exemption suspended for imports from those countries 
    4 e Authority to prohibit a U S  citizen from engaging in financial transactions with the government on the list without a license from the U S  government 
    4 f Prohibition of Defense Department contracts above $100 000 with companies controlled by countries on the list 

 

Sudanese might hit a damage much of the way they operate ICANN through the economic embargo on Sudan and the introduction of the policy in their work than the impact on the treatment of this organization for Sudanese who participate in its various committees  they face discrimination qualitative and regional and ethnic hateful limits the possibility of their participation in committees and obtaining financial support be adjusted to their participation in the periodic meetings of the organization   making them suffer in getting equal opportunities fair between them and the rest of the participants from other countries  This is a big disadvantage of ICANN and the wasting of human rights in Sudan  many Sudanese participated in many of the ICANN working groups   but unfortunately  they find it difficult not justified in the presence of direct meetings to which some Sudanese belong before the ICANN meeting  but unfortunately Sudanese candidacy suffering for equal chance for the meeting under the pretext of flimsy not convince any reasonable person who has experience of how the work of committees and ICANN agent double standard   After the policy must be the work of ICANN so as not to lose credibility and respect that the laws that support equal opportunities and justice among all stakeholders 

 

These problems that limit our participation in these meetings that set policy for ICANN 

 

All stakeholders -- individual users  governments  civil society  businesses  and members of the academic and technical community -- have a stake in preserving the Internet as a critical platform for communication and information exchange  and therefore all stakeholders should be included in governance decisions  But the embargo from USA to Sudan affect negatively in Information Technology and decrease the Revolution of the information Technology  and ICANN is organization registered in USA  so that it fellows the USA law 

 

These sanctions imposed by the United States  which has committed ICANN is attributed to the presence in America has made Sudan a backward country in the field of communication technology and the prohibition of work sites and programs affecting scientific and software applications that help in scientific research and development of technology   which affects the stakeholders of civil society organizations non- governmental organizations   universities and research institutes   Also affected universities clearly by banning sites of scientific programs and important in the field of scientific research and the development of trade and commerce and the electronic transfer of funds with the knowledge that Sudan does not have a credit card 

 

This boycott and embargo on Sudan wasted human rights in Sudan's access to information and freedom of the Internet and the free exchange of data and transparency and access to any information or a particular site to browse and take advantage of its information   We find that most of the applications and software task blocked and banned in Sudan   which have negatively impacted on the free exchange of information  With the lack of transparency and lack of interest n ICANN 

 

There are obvious solutions  which create a clear vision and explicit to deal with people and stakeholders in order to find mechanisms to ensure participation of all States and relevant stakeholders in the work of the Internet and lay starters transparency and the understanding and cooperation of all for the benefit of humanity and find quick solutions satisfactory for all  and confirmation on the principle of equality and non-encroachment on the rights of others in the use of the Internet  because the Internet is a life

It is a self-evident truth  wrote Thomas Jefferson  that governments  derive their just powers from the consent of the governed   If this statement is indeed so self-evidently true that NETmundial participants can agree to it  then it has important implications for the role of governments with respect to the multistakeholder model of Internet governance 

The role of governments has been one of the multistakeholder model s most controversial aspects  Before the development of the Internet  questions of global importance were always addressed by governments  with minimal involvement from other sources  The Internet now enables greater global coordination and problem solving without reliance upon governments  and indeed  Internet governance has so far been effected without the implementation of any clearly articulated role for governments at all 

The fact that governments are not evidently needed to coordinate global Internet resources raises the valid question of whether other stakeholder communities want governments to represent them or whether they want to represent themselves  Many are electing to represent themselves  On a consent-based view of the legitimacy of government  other stakeholder communities have this right 

Insofar as stakeholder communities elect to participate in Internet governance processes on their own account  governments should not have a primary role in Internet governance  Policy authority for Internet-related public policy issues is not  as the Tunis Agenda (a document agreed to only by governments) claims  the sovereign right of states  It is the sovereign right of the people  delegated to states as they see fit  which  in view of their participation on their own account  means not at all 

Instead  we should conceive of the role of government as a subordinate one  Governments should facilitate the participation of their domestic stakeholder communities in Internet governance processes  They do not have the right to advance positions that contradict the consensus of other domestic stakeholders because such exercises of government power do not reflect the consent of the governed and are therefore illegitimate 

If some stakeholder communities want and are able to represent themselves  it follows also that intergovernmental bodies are never the right fora to discuss matters relating to Internet governance  Stakeholder communities participate directly in Internet governance discussions because their governments do not adequately represent their views  Consequently  any process that relies on governments to represent the views of domestic stakeholder communities when those communities do not consent to that representation is illegitimate and exclusionary 

Finally  in exercising even their subordinate role of facilitating the participation of their domestic stakeholder communities  governments should subject themselves to rigorous standards of transparency so that domestic stakeholder communities can verify that they are being well served 

To conclude  a view of governmental legitimacy that is grounded in the consent of the governed has several implications for Internet governance  I invite fellow NETmundial participants to join me in endorsing the following high-level principles 

    The role of governments in the multistakeholder model is limited to the facilitation of the participation of their domestic stakeholder communities in Internet governance processes 
    Intergovernmental bodies are inappropriate fora to discuss matters relating to Internet governance 
    Governments should be subject to rigorous standards of transparency in matters relating to Internet governance

Much of the debate over Internet governance is a consequence of the fact that some resources  especially the Domain Name System (DNS)  are centralized and hierarchical  These resources raise questions of fairness  accountability  and power that are not easily resolved  This contribution does not directly address these difficult questions 

Rather  this contribution urges NETmundial participants to support continued experimentation in the decentralization of critical Internet resources through peer-to-peer systems  Such systems have the potential to improve name resolution security  provide censorship-resistance  and protect end-user privacy online  In addition  as peer-to-peer technologies mature  they raise the possibility of cutting the Gordian knot with respect to questions of control raised by centralized resources 

Existing peer-to-peer decentralized name systems use pseudo Top-Level Domains (TLDs) (such as  onion   bit  and  gnu) that do not yet exist in the DNS in order to avoid any unintended conflicts  Over 100 000 domain names are already in use in the  bit space alone  An Internet-Draft RFC by Grothoff et al  entitled  Special-Use Domain Names of Peer-to-Peer Systems  proposes to normalize the use of some pseudo-TLDs by reserving them for special use in the DNS per the procedure defined in RFC 6761 

 

While the Internet community must ultimately face the thorny questions relating to centralized Internet resources  we should also  on a parallel track  support continued experimentation in the decentralization of those resources through peer-to-peer technologies  One way to do this would be to express support  in principle  for the normalization of some peer-to-peer pseudo-TLDs as envisioned in the Grothoff Internet-Draft

Following the definition by UNESCO  Internet governance is understood as  the complementary development and application by governments  the private sector  civil society and the technical community  in their respective roles  of shared principles  norms  rules  decision-making procedures  and activities that shape the evolution and use of the Internet  (UNESCO 2012b) 

We understand Internet in strengthening democratic and democratizing societies by developing the Internet and its services with other area of public policy  This must be assured by promoting an open  transparent and inclusive approach to Internet Governance based on the principle of openness  encompassing the freedom of expression  respect for privacy  universal access and technical interoperability  including Ethics and the respect for cultural and linguistic diversity in cyberspace (see UNESCO 2014) 

The international partners and members of instkomm de request NETmundial to express its support for the proposals made during the Bali Internet Governance Forum (IGF 2013) and the Multi-stakeholder Advisory Group (MAG) to UN Secretary General  (1) With regard to surveillance and monitoring activities through the Internet  there is need for better protection for all citizens' privacy and security on line by balancing actions between national interests and respect for internationally recognized human rights; (2) representatives from several governments emphasized the importance of finding common ground amongst all stakeholders of certain cyber-ethics that place value on respecting local cultures on line while safeguarding users from emerging cyber threats; (3) the importance of strengthening and maintaining the multistakeholder spirit and mechanism in the Internet governance 

 

 

 

Following the view of UNESCO  there is need for a holistic and pluridisciplinary approach to address the growing complexity of the ecosystem Internet and its governance  We highlight the interdependence of the normative  technical  social components of this open ecosystem and the inseparability between issues of access  content and expression  Mechanisms have to be put in place to communicate  Internet Universality  based upon the strength and interdependence of    (i) the norm that the Internet Use is Human Rights based  (ii) the norm that it is non-discrimatory Open   (iii) the norm that highlights  Accessible to All   and (iv) the norm that it is nurtured by Multi-stakeholder Participation  (UNESCO 2013) 

 

 

 

Internet Universality is a precondition to construct information and knowledge societies (UNESCO 2012a)  combined with open access to information  ICT in education  information and media literacy in combination with Openness in content and technology including Open Access to Scientific Information  Open Educational Resources  Free and Open Source Software and Open Distance Learning 

 

 

 

Having present intercultural diversities we nevertheless claim all the best worldwide effort to shaping the global internet usage for all mankind  thus avoiding national or even regional restrictions and thresholds  We support the encouraging and funding of indispensable professional governmental and non-governmental organizations  institutions and associations

Principle S  No stakeholder group should define the roles and responsibilities of another stakeholder group  Nor should any Stakeholder group define its own roles  responsibilities in isolation from the other stakeholder groups 

 

In the Geneva Declaration of Principles Paragraph 49  the governments sitting in Geneva looked at the Internet - an Internet they had trouble defining  looked at governance of the Internet - a concept they could not define  and decided it was their responsiblity to define roles and responsibilities for all stakeholders  without an understanding of what it meant to be a stakeholder in the Internet   They also defined their own specific roles and responsibilities in isolation from the other stakeholder groups   In fact all of the roles and responsibilities were defined without any relation to the interrelation of roles and responsibilities or the complexities of changing roles and responsibilities over time and task 

 

Whether it was in the WGIG or during the later stages of WSIS and ever since  the governments have refused to reconsider the definitions made without the consent of the other stakeholders and without a full understanding of the interrelations and variability of roles and responsibility among actors in Internet governance

 

The definition by governments of the roles and responsibilities of other actors in Internet governance has been one of the most fundamental blocks to making progress on many of the issues of Internet governance   How does one cooperate and find consensus with a group that is incapable of recognizing ones actual roles and responsibilities 

 

We cannot go back and correct these government declarations  as much as some of us would like to do so   We can only move forward and try to understand and to recognize the actual roles that the various actors fill and the responsibilities they assume in these roles 

 

In defining the roles of various actors we may also do well to avoid the simple categorization of Government  Private Sector and Civil Society   Over the years it has become obvious that whether one was speaking of Governmental actors or Non-Governmental actors  the breakdown was far more complex that a simple triad 

 

In one respect it is fairly clear  there are Governmental and Non-Governmental actors  That is the original UN distinction and regardless of what the WSIS outcome documents say  that is essentially still the breakdown in effect   Whether it is the IGF MAG or UN Working Groups (WG) such as the WG of Internet governance (WGIG) or the WG on Enhanced Cooperation (WGEC)  half of the seats always go to Governmental actors and half of the seats go to Non-Governmental actors according to various proportionalities among the stakeholder groups within the Non-Governmental actors   The Governments are never willing to accept less than half of the seats   

 

Going forward  if we wish to make progress  we need to recognize the full diversity of stakeholders 

 

In terms of the subdivision of Non-Governmentals  that never breaks down as simply as Private Sector  Civil Society plus maybe Academia and Technical Community   As was seen in /1net  as soon as one starts to do any breakdown of stakeholder groups  further stakeholder groups appear  whether it is Private Sector breaking down into Big Business  Little Business  Service Provider  Registry  Registrar  Reseller or owner of intellectual property  it does not remain a fixed stakeholder group for very long   Likewise Civil Society quickly starts to break further into stakeholder groups like rights advocate  aid worker  philanthropy or NGO staff  Beyond these stakeholder groups  groups like Media and Librarians look for their place in the stakeholder mix   The basic Private Sector and Civil Society  though  don t begin to cover the groups like User  Community Informatics or Technical Community that can be either Private Sector  Civil Society or both 

 

Government stakeholders may also be broken down into stakeholder groups beyond the diplomats and bureaucrats that are the normal participants in the multistakeholder processes   As one starts to look at the Governmental stakeholders one quickly sees the emergence of other stakeholder groups such as regulators  legislators  jurists  military  intelligence workers  law enforcement  privacy and data protection officers  intergovernmental civil servant and others   The complexity of the issues being discussed often requires the participation of many of these stakeholder groups 

 

While the division between Governmental and Non-Governmental remains relatively clear  further breakdown is dependent on the task and hand and the skills needed   The ability to break down the roles of the various actors is often dependent on the task that is being discussed   One also finds that the same individual can occupy multiple roles at the same time  or diverse roles over an extended period of time   Government workers can be technical contributors   Technical contributors  and even civil society members  can be part of government delegations   Defining roles is complex and defies as simple a division as we find in the WSIS outcome documents 

 

When one starts to consider the responsibilities of each of these roles one finds that the responsibilities also vary over issues  time and are subject to the phase of a process  For example one stakeholder may have a primary responsibility while an Internet protocol is being designed  though other stakeholders would still have responsibilities that contributed to the trade-off decisions made in multistakeholder discussions   Once the protocol is designed  a different set of stakeholders may have the primary responsibility  without eliminating  the multistakeholder process that allows all to assume their responsibilities and contribute to developing appropriate policies and implementations  When it comes to making national public policy  a task where government workers have priority  all the other stakeholders still have their own responsibilities in the process   In terms of international Internet policy all stakeholders have roles and responsibilities  and because of their ability to create treaties and their obligations that derive from the Human Rights Declarations and Covenants  governments do have a special responsibility to defend the human rights  without having the primary responsibility for Internet public policy 

 

The roles and responsibilities of stakeholders are not fixed  they vary with the circumstance and the type of issue being dealt with  Divisions into 3  5  or 7 fixed stakeholder groups will always fall apart at some point in the process   This does not mean that there are stakeholder groups  though a multistakeholder model such as that in the IETF recognizes stakeholders without forcing them to divide themselves into fixed stakeholder groups   It does mean  however  that we need a more complex and fluid notion of stakeholders and stakeholder groups if we are going to fulfill the promise of the multistakeholder model  without always finding ourselves in the situation of either leaving some group out in the cold  or finding stakeholders shoehorning themselves into groups that do not quite fit the reality of their responsibilities 

 

We cannot change the the WSIS outcome documents   They are part of the history we are building the future of Internet governance upon   But we can rethink  and refine our understanding of these roles and responsibilities in light of reality and the experience we have gained over the years 

 

To return to the principles stated at the beginning of this note  No stakeholder may define the roles and responsibilities of other stakeholders  while at the same time no stakeholder group can define their own roles and responsibilities without interacting with the other stakeholder groups   The responsibility for defining roles and responsibilities belongs to all stakeholders working together   As we move forward  we need to set aside time and effort to better understand and recognize the diversity and complexity of roles and responsibilities in Internet governance

Internet Governance  scenarios of uncertainty and mistrust

 

The exhaustion of the current model of Internet Governance is an indisputable fact 

We are experiencing a period of disbelief and loss of credibility in the authorities and in the institutions that control the Internet Governance 

Several were the factors that have compelled us to these scenarios of uncertainty and mistrust  but the main factor of loss of credibility was the observation that  in the context of the Internet Governance  the modi operandi (practices) are different from modi verbali (discourses)    

Therefore  there is widespread concern due to complaints about the surveillance and espionage industries on the Internet by segments of the international investigative journalism because these industries considered strategic to fight against  terrorism  and the development of policies for cybersecurity under the signature of some countries and in favor also of authoritarian regimes  they are committing crimes against national sovereignty  human rights   in addition to being highly harmful to freedom of expression and organization 

 

With respect to complaints about espionage  the Brazilian government and the representation of the European Commission issued the following comments 

1  Recent revelations concerning the activities of the global network of electronic espionage have caused indignation and repudiation in public opinion around the world;1

2  Our fundamental freedoms and human rights are not negotiable  They must be protected on line 2

Another concern is the dispute exerted by large telecommunications monopolies by control and privatization of Internet Governance  because these monopolies desire to modify the patterns of Internet use  such as net neutrality  under the argument that their services are no longer to be profitable and that net neutrality delays the possibilities for innovation in the telecommunications industry 

 

The Internet as a common space and public good is under threat  especially when companies violate achievements such as the net neutrality and rights to privacy and free expression of thought 

In this context  the fundamental issues to be discussed should be  firstly  the principles that will ensure the non-violation of human rights; in the second place  the commitment to consolidate  in a perspective post-westfaliana of sovereignty  a multilateral decentralized and inter-operable governance  instituted by all users of this public space  i e  by governments  by the entrepreneurs of the private sector and the civil society organizations; thirdly  the guarantee of net neutrality  based on ethical and technical criteria   that can combat restrictions aimed at only the economic interests of some business monopolies 

2   Roadmaps for the construction of a different model of Internet Governance

 

    Combating all violations of human rights in the cyberspace;
    Consolidation of a decentralized multilateral Internet Governance  inter-operable and truly established in a consensual way with all users of public space  the governments  the entrepreneurs of the private sector and the civil society organizations;
    Guarantee of defense of net neutrality  against the restrictions arising from the economic interests of some monopolies business of telecommunications;
    Construction of mechanisms to prevent the illegal practices of surveillance and espionage of military and private industries in cyberspace;
    Restoration of confidence  the credibility and the tranquility on the cyberspace  from the creative and collective work maintained by representative actors of governments  entrepreneurs of the private sector and civil society organizations 

On the implementation of a different model ofInternet Governance  the Brazilian government and the representation of the European Commission recommended that it should be 

1  Open  multilateral and democratic governance  carried out with transparency by stimulating collective creativity and the participation of society  Governments and the private sector;

2  The Commission firmly supports a real multi-stakeholder governance model for the Internet based on the full involvement of all relevant actors and organizations

2  Check the press release (IP/14/142) addressed the press sent by the European Commission  presented on February 12  2014   http //europa eu/rapid/press net neutrality-release_IP-14-142_en htm

As noted in the Deauville G8 Declaration the internet has become essential to our societies and as such we envision a universal internet which embodies the principles as advocated by Brazilian President HE Dilma Rousseff in the 68 session of the United Nations General Assembly  In her speech to the assembly she addressed the following;

 

Creation of multilateral mechanism for the world wide network capable of ensuring principles such as; 1  Freedom of expression  privacy of the individual and respect of the human rights  2  Open  multilateral and democratic governance  carried out with transparency by stimulating collective creativity and the participation of society  governments and private sector  3 Universality that ensures the social and human development and the construction of inclusive and non-discriminatory societies  4  Cultural diversity  without the imposition of beliefs  customs and values  5  Neutrality of the network  guided only by technical and ethical criteria  rendering it inadmissible to restrict it for commercial  religious or any other purposes 

 

The creation of a multilateral mechanism would see to it that the present day institutions such as ICANN are reforrmed to meet the concerns raised by president Dilma  

 

Touching on the Principles we would wish to see discussed in the Global Stakeholder meeting  We would wish to see the issues of Human Rights enjoyed by netzens addressed  This is in light of state centric developments where freedoms and rights of individuals online are sacrificed at the behest of 'national security' concerns   Under this we recognise the Brazilian Internet steering committee's principles for the governance and use of the internet - Freedom  Privancy and Human Rights  Which is driven by the principles of expression  individual privacy and the respect of human rights  recognising them as essential to the preservation of a fair and democratic society  This is in light of the Edward Snowden revelations on the National Security Agency spying activities  

 

Universality of the internet

 

Certain stakeholders have been looking for avenues of bypassing the United States in a new internet artchitecture so as to prevent spying by United States but doing so would interfear with the Universality of the internet as we know it today  Hence  the global stakehoder meeting must come up with a way forward on the current universality of the internet taking on board the concerns of routing traffic through USA  This has been efficiently put forth by the European Union Vice-President Neelie Kroes;

 

We should safeguard the idea that  on the internet  every node can communicate with every other  This unity is what allows the internet to thrive in the way it has; we need to avoid fragmentation  - Neelie Kroes  European Union Vice-President

 

Security of the internet /Security on the internet

 

Cybersecurity is the one of the problems of our time  A number of convention have come to play with the Convention of Europe being the most predominan one while from the part of the world I hail from  the African Union is currently in the last stages finalising the draft African Union Cybersecurity Convention  All this are as a result of real concerns on security on the internet  This is bound to become more complicated as we enter into the era of 'internet of things'

Today there is no need to stress the fact that BRICS states have become on the most massive and at the same time the most rapidly growing segments of the global internet community  Enough to mention that in 2013 total number of internet users in BRICS states exceeded 700 mln (or 30% of the world s internet audience) while still experiencing a meteor growth ranging from 10% in China to 41%  The total contribution of the internet sector to BRICS economies in 2013 topped $500 bln  and yet the forecasts say it will double by 2015  In the nearest future BRICS will represent the most numerous and active part of the  digital society  of XXI century – and an

At the say time  the BRICS states are still underrepresented and passive in the field of global internet governance and its key trends including transformation of the global internet governance architecture  The debates conducted at the World Conference on International Telecommunications of the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) in December 2012 in Dubai  UAE proved that the developing countries mostly contribute to the agenda-shaping as secondary actors which support the positions of some key stakeholders – Russia  USA or the EU  But even more important is the rising giants from BRICS and the developing world still share a disproportionally small degree of participation in the process of forging and revision of technological principles and foundations of the global internet governance – and the Global Net itself 

Today  when the global internet governance is undergoing the period of a fundamental transformation the emerging leaders of the developing world have a unique window of opportunities which should be used to smooth these disproportions and to leverage non-Western participation in the global internet governance to a new level 

In this regard PIR Center has drafted Policy Recommendations on Global Internet Governance as a New Common Agenda for BRICS States which we are delighted to present at the NETMundial meeting 

1  The number of issues and volume of high-level debates on vital internet governance issues requires establishment of an institutionalized global and multistakeholder framework which would be able to function in a format close to 24/7/365 

In this regard  the mechanism and mandate of the Internet Governance Forum (IGF) established in 2006 following the 2005 WSIS Tunis Agenda might be developed and transformed in order to establish a permanent IGF Secretariat working on multistakeholder basis on the key goals and issues in the global internet governance agenda 

The BRICS States could not only provide full diplomatic support to this initiative and promote it at coming global internet governance debates (such as High-Level Meetings in the framework of the WSIS [World Summit on the Information Society] +10 Process) or the Global Multistakeholder Meeting on the Future of the Internet Governance in San-Paulu  Brazil) but also take a leading role in technical and administrative work on establishment of the Secretariat  Moreover  they might bring up the initiative of hosting it on a permanent basis – e g  in Brazil  South Africa or Russia  which might be a proper reflecting the increasing role of the rising powers in the ICT and internet governance agenda 

2  The key goal of such Permanent IGF Secretariat in a short-term and middle-term prospect might include elaboration of a Set of Principles of Global Internet Governance  It should be perceived as a milestone document summarizing the updated vision of all stakeholders on the global internet governance agenda and reflecting the major changes in this area since the adoption of the Okinawa Charter on Global Information Society of 2000 

However  unlike the Okinawa Charter  the new Set of Principles should be perceived as a next and unprecedented step in this field – a codification of the principles of internet governance which might be adopted in the form of the UN Convention or a Treaty  Thus  the idea is to negotiate and state the core principles of the global stakeholder interaction in the form of a legally binding act – which makes a great distance from the declarative status of the Okinawa Charter  The document would acknowledge and inherit already existing and widely accepted basic principles like the multi-stakeholder approach  network neutrality  openness  integrity  universality of the internet  etc 

Not going beyond far determination and postulation of key universally acknowledged principles of global internet governance the document might be regarded as a loose analogue of the Treaty on Principles Governing the Activities of States in the Exploration and Use of Outer Space  including the Moon and Other Celestial Bodies adopted on 19 December 1966 

There is no need to say that BRICS states can t and should not be the only initiators and conveyers of this process since it is obviously a global initiative requiring contribution from all stakeholders including all members of the UN  However  the new leaders from BRICS – each of them including Russia  China  Brazil  India and China – might take the lead of this process  thus making it more oriented towards the developing world stressing the changes in the global composition of stakeholders since the adoption of the Okinawa Charter and past WSIS Agendas 

One BRICS member should be specially mentioned here  and it s Russia  With its huge experience in global debates on the internet governance and cyber security issues which goes back to 1998 Russia has much to share with its BRICS partners and might lead them in implementation of this initiative 

3  Another Big Issue which should be included in the mandate and Strategic Plan of the Permanent IGF Secretariat is determination of the roots and reasons behind the massive governmental surveillance in the internet  Revelations made by Edward Snowden in 2013 made the global technical internet community and policy makers face a fundamental question  is systemic and global governmental surveillance in the Net a bug  or a feature of the existing global internet governance model  The answer might imply very concrete and far-reaching consequences on the technical level 

Acknowledging massive e-surveillance a direct consequence of systemic malfunction of the internet architecture in its present day form might imply far-reaching consequences on the technical layer  Let alone policy makers and the issues of trust in the international relations  this conclusion might trigger significant revision and update of the technical backbones of the internet  This includes the work of basic internet protocols (HTTP  TCP/IP) and traffic encryption standards  Such ideas already were announced at the recent meeting of the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) which took place in November 2013 in Vancouver  Canada 

BRICS states could facilitate the establishment and work of a Research Committee on Fundamental Vulnerabilities and Risks of the Internet Governance Architecture in the framework of the IGF Permanent Secretariat - or some other UN-based multistakeholder framework  The work of the Committee should be aimed at production and discussion of a Report with recommendations to international policy makers and the global technical internet community (Internet Society (ISOC)  IETF  ICANN  Internet Architecture Board (IAB)  etc ) 

It is important to use this initiative to promote inclusive and open character of activities in the field of exploring the internet governance architecture and its potential drawbacks  The Western states and Western stakeholders should not be driven out of the scope of the research and preparation of the recommendations otherwise the result would only contribute to balkanization and politicization of the internet governance  Hence  this initiative should incorporate or at least take into account both the outcomes of the Global Multistakeholder Meeting in Brazil and the activities of the two-year Global Commission on Internet Governance established in the end of 2013 and chaired by Sweden's Foreign Minister Carl Bildt 

4  Finally  if we go back to the thesis about underrepresentation of BRICS states in the global technical community and the internet governance policy-shaping process  we can t help mention the need to nurture technical experts and internet governance leaders in our countries 

In this regard  BRICS needs its own non-governmental Expert Council on Technical Issues of Internet Governance which would bring together technical experts from BRICS states and bridge them with such bodies as IETF  IAB  ISOC and others 

But a more important task is the launch of training and educational programs on internet governance  which would incorporate not only technical but also legal and political aspects of this agenda  Educational programs  higher educational courses should be not only supported with money and expertise  but also incorporated in the academic programmes of state universities and other institutions of higher education  In a middle-term and strategic prospect this will contribute to a greater contribution and a louder voice of BRICS experts in the work of IETF  IAB and other organizations shaping the future of the Net on technological level 

Strengthening of BRICS-ICANN cooperation is another perspective step in this direction  In fact the process has already started – the first steps were made with the decision to hold the Global Meeting in San Paulu negotiated between the Brazilian President Ms  Dilma Rousseff and the ICANN President Fadi Chehade in Fall 2013  Even before that ICANN launched dialogue on strategic cooperation with China and announced opening of its regional office in Beijing in 2012  In February 2014 ICANN President also made a three-day visit to China where his negotiations with three Chinese Ministers further strengthened this strategic dialogue and cooperation  Russia now looks  a missed link  in this chain of emerging cooperation between ICANN and BRICS states  and the BRICS format might become an optimal framework for Moscow to advance its level of dialogue with ICANN 

Finally  BRICS analogue of the Internet Governance Forum might be organized to provide a framework of cooperation between BRICS and ICANN (and ISOC) and provide greater internal integrity of the positions of the BRICS states towards key issues of global internet governance  This step might be implemented in 2015 already 

***

PIR Center does not regard BRICS and its activities as a panacea for the problems existing in the field of global internet governance  Neither have we considered global internet governance to be a future backbone of the BRICS format 

However  we feel that ICT agenda might significantly strengthen the added-value of the Forum in one of the most topical areas of international relations and at the same time strengthen BRICS identity and integrity  Transborder nature of the internet makes the BRICS format free of its most serious weaknesses such as clash of regional interests and mismatch of geographically determined agendas  Instead the Net brings our states and stakeholders together in its digital reality  and this is a chance not to miss for BRICS

A framework for nations  strategic policy choices for cyber-conflicts associated with various sources

Table 1 here

Theoretically  the international institutional framework for cybersecurity is structurally imperfect and deficient from an industrial country s perspective   Based on the above discussion  the relationships among countries from the perspective of cybersecurity-related relationships can be divided into four groups that pose different dominant challenges when viewed from a Western country s perspective (Table 1) 

Local capacity building in law enforcement and institutional development

Some emerging economies  law enforcement system capacity to deal with cybercrime has become the dominant challenge that limits their ability to fight cybercrimes  EBay sAlbena

Spasova  who worked in promoting law reform in Moldova and Bulgaria noted   Even in 2001  I was meeting judges who thought cyber-crime was someone stealing a computer  (Wylie  2007)  Local capacity building and institutional development can produce effective results in strengthening global cybersecurity  As an example  consider Romania As of 2013  the U S  Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) trained about 600 Romanian investigators in fighting cybercrime (Odobescu  2014)  Some affected private sector players have also contributed to promote institutional and law enforcement capacity development  To take an example  eBay has been educating Romanian prosecutors about cybercrimes including explaining to a judge using layman s language (Wylie  2007)  In response to the rise of Romania-originated cybercrimes  the Council of Europe selected the capital city Bucharest for its latest cybercrime program office 

Creation of informal networks and agreements

Trans-governmental informal networks consisting of regulators and public officials are becoming an increasingly common feature of global governance(Bach and Newman  2010)  Such networks exist in areas such as financial markets  aviation  antitrust  data privacy  pharmaceuticals  and environment (Bach  2010; Newman  2008)  Officials from many countries work together to share information  develop harmonized guidelines and best practices  and reduce frictions 

Since 2009  the FBI permanently based a cybercrime expert in Estonia  The FBI worked closely with the Estonian Police and Border Guard  which led to the arrest of six Estonians  who allegedly hijacked over 4 million computers in over 100 countries and illegally made at least US$ 14 million (Kshetri  2013b)  Since 2009  the FBI has also stationed a special agent at the U S  Embassy in Kiev  In 2010  the SBU arrested five alleged kingpins of a criminal group  which stole US$ 70 million from U S  bank accounts (Onyshkiv and Bondarev  2012) 

On the contrary  the systems used by China and the U S are inefficient   If one country needs the help of the other  a request for assistance takes place through an exchange of letters  In 2010  the FBI office in Beijing reportedly forwarded 10 letters through the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and received responses to two  This is in sharp contrast to the deeper and stronger collaborations and partnerships between the U S  and EU countries  For instance  the European Electronic Crimes Task Force  which has dedicated personnel from the countries involved to investigate and prosecute cybercrimes  provides a forum for law enforcement agencies  the private sector  and academia 

Providing opportunities for developing economies  voice and participation

Treaties involving alliances and broad policy guidelines are sustained only by perceptions of mutual advantage (Baxter  1980)  Making efforts to understand developing economies  problems from their point of view and providing opportunities for their voice and participation would help explore mutual advantage and encourage their participation in formal international frameworks  Attempting to achieve too much too rapidly is often counterproductive   One way to gain their cooperation would be exclude issues from formal treaties that are objected by developing countries and are only tangentially related to cybercrime such as software piracy 

Establishment of a high level working group made up of policy makers

External pressures can do little to force nations to change their cyberspace behaviors since outsiders lack broad legitimacy  In order to find a solution that satisfies both parties  it is important to engage policy makers and national elites with strong commitment to a soft approach to and interested in developing a better relationship with adversaries  We illustrate this with the following observation involving China-U S  relationships in cyberspace 

At a hearing of the U S  House Foreign Affairs subcommittee on Asia  the director of the technology program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies noted   We need to persuadethe Chinese to change their behavior; we can t coerce them  they re too big  There are factions within China that want to work with us  We need to encourage them  (Freedberg  2013)  One way is to use a soft approach  It was reported that the Subcommittee chairman  Steve Chabot was willing to adopt a soft strategy  Likewise  there are factions within the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) that consider integration with the world desirable  Like-minded policy makers from both countries who prefer soft approach and seek to ameliorate the root causes of cyber-threats through negotiation  conciliation and compromise can help incrementally develop formal and informal relationships 

A 'bricolage' approach to cybersecurity

The different approaches to protect against cybercrimes discussed earlier do not directly deal with the fundamental sources of the problem  For instance  for most former Soviet Union economies  the basic source of the problem can be traced to the fact that most of them are too small to absorb the existing computer talent (Serio and Gorkin  2003)  A self-described hacker from Moscow noted   Hacking is one of the few good jobs left here  (Walker  2004) 

 In this regard  combining components from the existing institutions and reorganizing strategically—or bricolage—can be an important way to enhance cooperation (Campbell  2004)  For instance  Western companies can work closely with governments to help develop the ICT industry would help address the concerns regarding the West s monopolization in ICT products 

Identifying and achieving cooperation on common areas of interest

Identifying and achieving cooperation on common areas of interest may help secure a "foot-in-the-door" for a subsequent more significant collaboration  To take an example  in 2011  Chinese authorities and the FBI conducted joint operations to shut down a child pornography website (Lan  2011)  The Chinese government has thus taken at least symbolic actions to collaborate with the U S   Theorists argue that a symbolic action may lead to more substantive actions subsequently (Campbell  2004) 

Helping  encouraging and providing incentives to integrate with the West

Cybercriminals can take advantage of jurisdictional arbitrage by operating from economies with outdated legislative framework and the lack of law enforcement system capacity  They can do so even more effectively by operating from economies with a low degree of cooperation and integration with the West  Emerging economies  deeper integration with the West would force them modernize legislative frameworks and enhance system capacity and law enforcement 

A related point is that multiplex relationships make sanctions effective (Bardhan  1993)  For instance  Russia is making progress to join the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD)  If Russia gains an OECD membership  it may experience additional pressures associated with the membership and its engagement in cybersecurity-related cooperation may improve 

Harnessing the power of successful regional organizations

One way to compensate some of the deficiencies of the existing cybersecurity-related international institutions is to harness the power of regional organizations  especially consisting of developing nations that are not signatories to the CoECoC  Successful regional organizations that are internally cohesive and have security as a key focus are logical candidates   The ASEAN is one example that fits these criteria and has been effective in managing its internal security relations (Narine 1998)  Some economies  engagement with the ASEAN has focused on cybersecurity  Since 2009  the ASEAN and Japan have collaborated on cybersecurity  Relevant ministries and agencies such as Computer Security Incident Response Teams (CSIRTs) of ASEAN Members and Japan have focused on initiatives such as Internet Traffic Monitoring Data Sharing (TSUBAME) Project (http //tinyurl com/p44yx82)  Likewise  in July 2013  a U S  delegation participated at the 20th Meeting of the ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF) in Brunei Darussalam  Cybersecurity is one of the four core areas addressed by the ARF within its work on counterterrorism and transnational crime (http //tinyurl com/m4vedhb) 

Offensive and defensivecapabilitiestailored to specific threats

The responses discussed thus far are appropriate only if the sources of cyber-attacks have formal diplomatic and economic ties  In the absence of such ties  cybersecurity may require a balance of offensive and defensivecapabilities  Proactive defense tailored to specific threats is important  For instance  in response to North Korea-originated GPS attacks  South Korea is developing advanced GPS technologies

One way to compensate some of the deficiencies of the existing cybersecurity-related international institutions is to harness the power of regional organizations  especially consisting of developing nations that are not signatories to the CoECoC  Successful regional organizations that are internally cohesive and have security as a key focus are logical candidates   The ASEAN is one example that fits these criteria and has been effective in managing its internal security relations (Narine 1998)  Some economies  engagement with the ASEAN has focused on cybersecurity  Since 2009  the ASEAN and Japan have collaborated on cybersecurity  Relevant ministries and agencies such as Computer Security Incident Response Teams (CSIRTs) of ASEAN Members and Japan have focused on initiatives such as Internet Traffic Monitoring Data Sharing (TSUBAME) Project (http //tinyurl com/p44yx82)  Likewise  in July 2013  a U S  delegation participated at the 20th Meeting of the ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF) in Brunei Darussalam  Cybersecurity is one of the four core areas addressed by the ARF within its work on counterterrorism and transnational crime (http //tinyurl com/m4vedhb) 
Offensive and defensivecapabilitiestailored to specific threats
The responses discussed thus far are appropriate only if the sources of cyber-attacks have formal diplomatic and economic ties  In the absence of such ties  cybersecurity may require a balance of offensive and defensivecapabilities  Proactive defense tailored to specific threats is important  For instance  in response to North Korea-originated GPS attacks  South Korea is developing advanced GPS technologies

Executive Summary
Overview
Although cyber conflict is no longer considered particularly unusual  significant
uncertainties remain about the nature  scale  scope and other critical features of it  This
study addresses a subset of these issues by developing an internally consistent framework
and applying it to a series of 17 case studies  We present each case in terms of (a) its
socio-political context  (b) technical features  (c) the outcome and inferences drawn in
the sources examined  The profile of each case includes the actors  their actions  tools
they used and power relationships  and the outcomes with inferences or observations  Our
findings include 
  Cyberspace has brought in a number of new players – activists  shady government
contractors – to international conflict  and traditional actors (notably states) have
increasingly recognized the importance of the domain 
  The involvement of the private sector on cybersecurity ( cyber defense ) has been
critical  16 out of the 17 cases studied involved the private sector either in attack
or defense 
  All of the major international cyber conflicts presented here have been related to
an ongoing conflict ( attack  or  war ) in the physical domain 
  Rich industrialized countries with a highly developed ICT infrastructure are at a
higher risk concerning cyber attacks 
  Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) is by far the most common type of cyber
attack 
  Air-gapped (not connected to the public Internet) networks have not been exempt
from attacks 
  A perpetrator does not need highly specialized technical knowledge to intrude
computer networks 
  The potential damage of a cyber strike is likely to continue increasing as the
Internet expands 
  The size of the actor under attack could have an influence on its ability to deter
the attackers with actions in the physical world 
  The entrance barriers (including the monetary cost) for any actor to get involved
in a conflict seem to be much lower in the cyber domain than in the physical
domain 
  Accountability on the Internet is difficult  and gets further obscured when the
attacks transcend national borders  This fact has probably made cyber attacks
desirable for major military powers such as China  Russia and the United States 
In many ways  this paper is a re-analysis of the case studies set presented on A Fierce
Domain  Conflict in Cyberspace  1986 to 2012 recently published by the Atlantic
Council  In addition  we draw upon other materials (academic and media) to expand our
understanding of each case  and add several cases to the original collection resulting in a
data set of 17 cyber conflict  spanning almost three decades (1985-2013)  Cuckoo's Egg

Method And Organization
This study presents each case in terms of (a) its socio-political context  (b) technical
features  (c) the outcome and inferences drawn in the sources examined  Emphasis is
placed on characteristics of cyberspace visible on conflicts 
Present work is divided in several sections  Part I presents the cases in terms of the actors
involved  their power relationship  main actions  layers of the Internet affected  and
outcome  Part II expands on the tools and instruments used on the cyber offensive and
defensive actions described on Part I  including an extended view of the layers of the
Internet affected  Part III presents the author s inferences and observations for each case 
highlighting features of cyber conflict  Part IV presents a set of conclusions highlighting
critical features related to  actors  socio-political context  tools and other technical issues 
sophistication of the attacks  outcome and damage  and accountability 
Countries Involved
Findings presented in this study are U S -centered  as this paper was developed using
such a focus  However  23 countries are involved in at least one case  either in attack or
defense  Countries involved in two or more cases are (frequency in parenthesis)  United
States (16)  Russia (7)  China (3)  Israel (3)  The Netherlands (2) and Germany (2)  Six of
the cases presented had a global reach

Abstract
Twenty years ago  the possibility of having an international conflict extend into the cyber domain
was distant  Since then much has changed  Today cyber conflict is not considered particularly
unusual  But considerable uncertainties remain about the nature  scale  scope and other features of
such conflicts  This paper addresses these issues using a re-analysis of the case studies presented
in A Fierce Domain recently published by the Atlantic Council  In addition  we draw upon other
materials (academic and media) to expand our understanding of each case  and add several cases
to the original collection resulting in a data set of 17 cyber conflict  spanning almost three
decades (1985-2013)  Cuckoo's Egg  Morris Worm  Solar Sunrise  EDT  ILOVEYOU  Chinese
Espionage  Estonia  Russo-Georgian war  Conficker  NSA-Snowden  WikiLeaks and Stuxnet are
some of the major cases included  This study presents each case in terms of (a) its socio-political
context  (b) technical features  (c) the outcome and inferences drawn in the sources examined 
The profile of each case includes the actors  their actions  tools they used and power relationships 
and the outcomes with inferences or observations  Emphasis is placed on characteristics of
cyberspace visible on conflicts  Findings include  Distributed Denial of Service is the most
common offensive action; accountability is difficult in cyberspace  particularly with international
conflicts; outcomes of each instance have been variable  and economic impact is hard to estimate;
the private sector has been a key player in cybersecurity; size of an actor  and countries' ICT
infrastructure  influence the nature of the cyber conflicts

I
do
not
intend
to
describe
the
Internet
in
more
detail 
but
it
is
not
hard
to
see
how
this
enormous 
messy
network
can
be
a
policymaker s
nightmare 
How
do
you
regulate
a
network
that
is
so
poorly
understood
by
most
of
its
users 
How
can
the
government
issue
any
policies
pertaining
a
network
that
was
built
and
is
operated
and
serviced
almost
exclusively
by
private
actors 
The
Internet 
however 
did
not
emerge
out
of
nowhere 
ISPs
consist
mostly
of
cable
TV
and
telephone
providers 
especially
for
residential
users 
With
the
advent
of
Voice
over
Internet
Protocol
(VoIP)
and
web
video
streaming 
these
companies
faced
a
dilemma 
On
the
one
hand 
they
had
clear
incentives
to
block
or
degrade
the
performance
of
services
that
directly
competed
with
their
own
offerings
of
traditional
cable
TV
and
telephone 
On
the
other
hand 
their
consumers
demanded
new
applications 
such
as
Netflix 
YouTube 
or
Skype 
to
be
delivered
over
the
Internet
for
which
they
pay
money
every
month 
Other
than
protection
of
intellectual
property 
the
regulation
of
this
apparent
conflict
of
interest
has
been
the
most
important
Internet
policy
controversy
in
recent
times 
Network  Neutrality 
In
the
United
States 
the
Federal
Communication
Commission
(FCC)
is
the
closest
thing
to
an
Internet
regulatory
agency 
During
the
George
W 
Bush
Administration 
however 
the
FCC
Alexander
Gamero-­-Garrido
|
Technology
and
Policy
Program 
MIT
decided
that
it
would
take
a
hands-­-off
approach 
and
classified
the
Internet
as
an
Information
Service 
By
doing
so 
the
FCC
itself
greatly
restricted
its
regulatory
authority
over
the
Internet 
As
more
services
move
online 
calls
for
regulation
became
increasingly
frequent 
One
of
FCC s
responses
to
such
calls
was
the
2010
Open
Internet
Report
and
Order
(OIRO) 
which
among
other
things
prevented
ISPs
from
blocking
entire
classes
of
Internet
traffic
(e g 
VoIP) 
In
the
words
of
the
Commission 
 broadband
providers
should
not
pick
winners
and
losers
on
the
Internet—even
for
reasons
that
may
be
independent
of
providers 
competitive
interests
(…)  2
What
did
the
commissioners
mean
by
 pick[ing]
winners
and
losers  
From
a
bird s
eye
view 
they
refer
to
a
limited
and
valuable
resource 
residential
bandwidth 
In
this
context 
bandwidth
refers
to
the
speed
with
which
a
connection
can
transmit
information 
and
is
normally
measured
in
megabytes
per
second 
It
is
the
FCC s
policy
that
it
should
be
the
consumer 
and
not
the
ISP 
who
selects
how
bandwidth
should
be
allocated 
Although
this
seems
to
point
to
a
proposition
of
liberty
(from
ISP
limitations) 
it
is
an
argument
about
equity 
Every
consumer
should
have
the
right
to
select
from
her
favorite
service
provider 
and
such
provider
should
be
allocated
an
equal
portion
of
the
available
bandwidth
on
the
ISP
network 
As
with
Stone s
chocolate
cake3 
splitting
bandwidth
equally
is
not
necessarily
the
fairest
distribution 
Specific
applications
such
as
VoIP
are
more
time-­-sensitive
than
others 
such
as
bulk-­-transfers4 
ISPs 
then 
routinely
have
to
prioritize
entire
classes
of
traffic
over
others 
Since
you 
my
theoretical
neighbor 
are
having
a
telephone
conversation
that

messed
up

that

incomplete

misleading 
In

not

of

this
one
plays
only
half
of
the

(the
sad

half) 
It
conveniently
leaves
out
that
the
Internet
infrastructure
was
largely
built
on
public
land 
under
government
concessions 
and
that
therefore
ISPs
are
not
the
 owners 
of
such
a
network9 
They
might
own
the
wires 
and
they
might
have
paid
for
digging
the
pipes 
But
to
 own 
the
residential
Internet
is
a
very
different
thing 
a
much
bigger
ownership
claim
that
does
not
stand
minimal
scrutiny 
Firstly 
ISPs
accepted
a
great
deal
of
control
over
their
telephone
and
cable
networks
in
exchange
for
building
on
public
land10 
Secondly 
the
Internet
is
much
more
than
a
 series
of
tubes 11 
as
it
relies
on
many
protocols
and
soft
tools
that
have
been
developed
by
the
technical
community 
one
that
spans
way
beyond
the
ISPs
themselves 
Thirdly 
and
as
with
many
infrastructures12 
there
is
much
more
to
be
extracted
from
the
Internet
than
its
simple
data
transmission
capabilities 
As
I
argued
in
my
opening
paragraph 
the
Internet
is
now
ubiquitous 
It
is
hard
to
imagine
living
a
modern
life
without
the
Internet 
More
than
a
nice
thing
to
have 
the
Internet
has
become
a
necessity 
and
it
greatly
impacts
the
welfare
(or
the
 well
being )
of
the
American
people 
To
claim
that
the
ISPs
should
be
the
only
ones
with
a
word
to
say
about
residential
network
management
practices
is
to
claim
that
ISPs
have
final
ruling
over
welfare
of
its
millions
of
users 
It
is
effectively
a
call
for
a
form
of
private
government

Insufficiencies of ICANN present legal and accountability framework

ICANN is a nonprofit private organization legally operating within the State of California (US) jurisdiction with the responsibility of technical coordination of the global Internet system of unique identifiers (DNS – Domain Name System) and ensuring its stable and secure operation 

 

It initiated activities on the basis of a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) signed by the US government and ICANN in 1998 for a two year period  aiming to privatize and develop a system of bottom-up technical management of part of the DNS tasks previously performed by or on behalf of the US government   in a manner that reflects the global and functional diversity of Internet users and needs   while  increasing competition  and  facilitating international participation in its management  

 

The MoU was extended by six successive Amendments up to 2006  when it was replaced by a Joint Project Agreement (JPA) for a three year period  and  later  by an Affirmation of Commitments (AOC)  signed in 2009 by the US government and ICANN  institutionalizing the technical coordination of the Internet DNS by ICANN  through an accountable and transparent Multistakeholder bottom-up policy development model reflecting the public interest 

 

The development of an international Multistakeholder Model of policy development by ICANN has been an obvious success and ICANN operation has proved effective for ensuring a scalable  secure  stable and resilient DNS management  However  two important issues stand unsolved 

 

             (i)     The US government has a relationship with ICANN boldly asymmetrical when compared with other nations as it remains the sole entity to which ICANN is formally bound through the AOC;

 

           (ii)     The ICANN remains an organization under Californian jurisdiction  in striking contrast with the objective of accountability to multistakeholders worldwide 

Both need swift fixing 

 
Promote the signature of AOCs with others

 

Issue (i) can be practically overcome by promoting the signature of similar AOCs with other nations willing to do it  in particular those who are current members of ICANN GAC – Governmental Advisory Committee  as well as with others who may wish to join  and of appropriate AOCs with nongovernmental and intergovernmental organizations of the Internet ecosystem with which ICANN engages  Naturally  this should be an open and flexible process allowing for different timings and accommodating reasonable specificities – it is very natural that no one size fits all!

 
Institutionalize ICANN according to international law

 

Issue (ii)  on the other hand  requires an innovative solution  Due to its worldwide reach it is clear that ICANN should stand on international law  with international arbitration and with statutes institutionalizing accountability to worldwide multistakeholders   

 

This objective cannot be achieved within intergovernmental organizations  but it is feasible and practical within the established international legal framework  similarly to international research labs but with statutes explicitly stating accountability to worldwide multistakeholders and the associated regimes of engagement   Such a step has the additional merit of providing a possible legal mechanism to institutionalize the engagement of worldwide multistakeholders and ICANN s accountability to them 

 

This action will bring institutional stability to an arrangement that several parties in the world challenge and confront every year  while reinforcing and institutionalizing the Multistakeholder Model that has proved so valuable for Internet policy development and management 

 

Maintaining ICANN functions performed by a US-California law organization is contradictory to its worldwide public interest and one-Internet objectives  Thus  it requires a consistent solution within the international law framework as proposed (see the final note on globalization versus internationalization) 

 
Accountability of Root-Zone and IANA functions to worldwide multistakeholders

 

In the same vein as the US government took the initiative with the 1998 MoU of initiating the privatization of the Internet DNS technical management to ICANN and entrusted it to develop a bottom-up management system (later explicitly acknowledged as the Multistakeholder Model)  in a manner that reflects the global and functional diversity of Internet users and needs   as a matter of principle and coherence it should  as well  initiate a process of privatization and accountability to worldwide multistakeholders  for the IANA functions  In fact  it is contradictory for the US to secure command-and-control of IANA functions given their important role in the one-Internet worldwide multistakeholder system of now-a-days 

 

Some voices have called for such a development  asking for the creation of a new organization on the basis of a presumed need for separation policy development from operations  However  it is not understandable why such a separation is necessary in this case  On the contrary  it does not appear to exist any possible conflict of interests involved  and most likely entrusting policy development and operations to the same accountable organization would improve effectiveness and efficiency  So  the privatization of IANA functions and their accountability to worldwide multistakeholders can be entrusted to ICANN and its institutionalization within international law would accomplish the needed evolution of responsibility for IANA functions 

 
A web of organizations layer

 

It is common place to look at the Internet architecture as a layered structure  Layered structures  web of interactions  loose coupling  neutrality of flows  end-to-end communications are essential characteristics of evolving robust complex systems  natural or human made  It is not by accident that throughout biological evolution such characteristics surfaced as a result of  survival of the fittest   In human made systems open standards and protocols are an additional requirement that is implicitly assured in nature 

 

For robustness  effective sustainable operation and future evolution of the Internet it is paramount to nurture an organizational layer as an open web of organizations standing on the same characteristics as enunciated above for the Internet and complex systems in general  What is needed is to strengthen the flows between web nodes – as usually in networks  the flows are much more important than the nodes  Regular flows require open communication/engagement protocols  and this holds for organizations as it does for technical infrastructure 

 

For organizations  the communication/engagement protocols assume the form of a set of agreements between groups of two or more organizations  which must be open in the sense of being crafted appropriately for the engagement needs of each pair or related group of involved organizations and being known to all  Such agreements should be centered in specifying the concrete nature of the mutual relationships and flows and the associated simplified protocols of communication and joint work 

 

Examples of obvious nodes for such a web of organizations layer are the more than 20 organizations identified in the recently published Draft Report of ICANN s Strategy Panel on the Role in the Internet Governance Ecosystem as part of the descriptions of this ecosystem  Such a web of organizations must be seen as an open and evolving network like the Internet itself that can be joined by other organizations or rearranged throughout time 

 

To materialize this web of organizations layer it is necessary to establish the communication/engagement protocols between such organizations  making them explicit  simple and openly known to all  This will materialize effective relationships of Enhanced Cooperation between nodes of this web of organizations 

 

The robustness and evolutionary strength that this sort of web of organizations layer can bring to Internet governance is similar to those already demonstrated by the Internet operation itself 

 

* * *
Final note  On globalization versus internationalization

 

It has been voiced that it would be desirable that ICANN globalizes and not internationalizes  According to the established understanding of these terms  such a call is difficult to understand and conveys confusing signals  when a self-interested corporation owned by individuals of some nation reaches out to do business worldwide for exploiting opportunities of self-profit we say the corporation is globalizing  Also  the current so-called  globalization process  is generally recognized as being associated with the opening of international trade agreements 

 

Neither of these two meanings are acceptable for ICANN reaching out worldwide and be accountable to worldwide multistakeholders in the public interest!

 

Clearly  the meaning of international organization does not imply that its nature must be just between Nation States  and it is fully compatible with the involvement of worldwide multistakeholders of all possible organizational or individual origins  as desirable for ICANN 

 

International law and international arbitration procedures provide an appropriate framework for the evolution of ICANN institutional nature and the strengthening of its accountability to worldwide multistakeholders  So  it appears most appropriate to internationalize ICANN

Executive Summary

The ever-increasing relevance of the Internet in all aspects of our lives –reaching over 2 7 billion users around the world  has significantly raised the interest of cyberspace in the political  economical and international spheres  Internet governance and the future design of the Internet are now relevant to many different stakeholders eagers to engage and influence the decision-making and policy-making process 

The Internet Corporations for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) is recognized as the central institution involved in the governance of the global Internet  Specifically  it is in charge of the allocation and coordination of the critical Internet resources –Internet Protocol addresses  Domain Names System and protocols  and of policy development related to this function 

At its creation  ICANN was expected to have a technical mandate  However  as its scope reached the political and economical world  changes in its structure where introduced  resulting in a large and complex institution  with several internal bodies intermingled in its functions  The in-depth analysis of the legal  financial and public documents of ICANN  as well as the information and documents published directly by ICANN s internal bodies  reveals the substantial expansion in scale and scope of ICANN mandate and activities since its creation 

Clearly  ICANN has succeeded in creating a structure where Internet users  companies  not-for-profit organizations  Internet service providers  registries  registrars  Top-Level domain managers  Regional Internet Registries  other organizations in the Internet governance ecosystem and even government and treaty organizations have a place to contribute in policy development concerning the global Internet  ICANN has seven internal bodies where these different constituencies are spread and sometimes mixed 

Additionally  ICANN has been the institution in charge of coordinating and managing the technical functions of the Internet  as well as policy making related to these functions since 1998  When it was created  there were less than 10% of the current total Internet users and the World Wide Web potential was just emerging  At that time  most of social interactions through the Internet were done by email or other messaging systems such as Microsoft Messenger and ICQ  Even today  a very limited number of Internet users know what ICANN is or what ICANN does  Very seldom does an Internet user asks his or herself who runs the top-level management of IP addresses  of top-level domains  of protocols and other parameters  because the Internet works 

ICANN has been able to cope and adapt to growth  evolution and change of the Internet and its usages  ICANN complex and iterative processes for policy development building bottom up from its constituencies  has allowed it to absorb and act accordingly to changes and evolution  Additionally  this same complex network organizing constituencies in internal bodies and external organizations that collaborate with ICANN is an outreach mechanism for ICANN to its constituencies  providing necessary buy-in for the policy development processes in place 

However  although ICANN has only two categories of internal bodies  there are tangible differences in the involvement of these two categories in ICANN s functions and with ICANN policy development and decision-making processes  Moreover  as some constituencies did not engaged as described in the bylaws  the different stakeholders do not have the same power or influence in ICANN  For instance  one of the main links of ICANN with the International System is the Governmental Advisory Committee  which fails to be a sufficient mechanism for many governments  This committee is in the delicate position of being an advisory committee but with more influence and internal links than other structures  However  it uses them seldom  This difference and internal inequality will possibly be sources of future contentions 

Adding to this complexity is the fact that not all ICANN s internal bodies were created at the same time  nor use the same instrument as definition  Hence  there is not a unified document where the principles governing the structure and work of ICANN are clearly exposed  ICANN s reforms of 2002  as well as some ongoing processes  addressed and are addressing this issue in an effort to reconcile the governing principles with the operation of the institution 

As a conclusion  a critical principle the Internet governance of the future has to consider is the capacity of absorbing and adapting to change; but  at the same time  its processes and the role of its different organizations have to be clearly stated and represent the real mechanisms  There are still more than three billion potential new Internet users on the world and many new usage trends are just emerging  What would be the killer Internet application in ten years  The new Internet governance system has to be able to enable it and evolve with it  and the different actors of Internet governance have to understand their role in the process
