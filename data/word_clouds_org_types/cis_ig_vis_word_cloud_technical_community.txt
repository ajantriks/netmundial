  Introduction
    This submission is from InternetNZ (Internet New Zealand Inc) 
    Our vision is of a better world through a better Internet 
    Our mission is to promote the Internet’s benefits and uses  and protect its
potential 
    We are a membership based  charitable  not-for profit and non-partisan
organisation  working on a wide range of Internet and related
telecommunications issues on behalf of the Internet Community in New
Zealand – both users and the industry as a whole  We work for New
Zealanders on sharing the gains the Internet can bring  for everyone 
    InternetNZ is an At-Large Structure within the ICANN community and is
responsible for the administration of the  nz top level domain 
    InternetNZ has two wholly-owned charitable subsidiaries to whom
management  operation and regulation of the  nz top level domain are
delegated  These are 
       nz Registry Services  the Registry
      Domain Name Commission  the Regulator
    InternetNZ has developed a set of principles for TLD administration  in line
with which we operate the  nz TLD  https   internetnz net nz TLDPrinciples
  Summary
    This submission is in support of the contribution from the Internet Governance
Project (IGP) entitled  Roadmap for globalizing IANA  Four principles
and a proposal for reform   
    The IGP contribution sets out four principles to guide IANA contract reform 
which InternetNZ supports  These principles mirror the conclusions we have
reached independently and have practised in our management of the  nz TLD 
    The model proposed by the IGP  particularly for the establishment of a new
body  the DNS Authority  is one that we support in principle  though further
refinement of the model are necessary 
    We offer qualifications and points of detail for consideration in the discussion of
this model in the following sections of this content contribution 
  Principle   - Completely separate root zone file modification
from policymaking
    InternetNZ has long argued for structural separation between the IANA
function and ICANN   In our view the separation of the IANA registry function
from ICANN's broader policymaking function is in the best interests of TLD
managers and of Internet users as a whole  As we noted in our submission to
the NTIA 
    Experience within the  nz TLD has shown that functional separation of the registry
from the policy development entity  with neither in a position of control over the other 
provides significant and necessary safeguards for the customers  These include 
      All registry decisions are directly traceable to a publicly available policy
document  Any gap in this audit trail is a breach of the contract under
which the registry operates and would be expected to lead to contractual
sanctions 
      The registry can refuse to carry out any request that does not conform to
the publicly available policy  without any threat of action against it or any
individual as the registry is not contracted to any policy development
entity 
      Both the registry and the policy development entity are fully developed
functions  without the priorities of one limiting the investment and
development of the other 
    The approach set out by the IGP is in principle a viable model to achieve this
structural separation  Further detail will of course need to be developed 
  Principle   - Don’t internationalize political oversight  end it
    The IANA contract is often regarded as the key element to be tackled for
ending political oversight of the root  If the strict separation between policy
making and operation of the IANA registry that IGP proposes were in place  it
would be recognised by all concerned that the real issue is political oversight of
the policy making function and not the technical body that implements that
policy 
    By the permanent transfer of the IANA contract to the DNSA  as proposed by
IGP  the IANA function returns to a purely technical function which no state
has oversight of and which requires no political oversight 
    InternetNZ would not support the allocation of the IANA functions to another
politically controlled body of any sort  We believe a separation of multistakeholder
policymaking from technically focused and robust operational
entities are the right way to conduct Internet governance 
  Principle   - Align incentives to ensure the accuracy and
security of root zone maintenance
    For the proposed DNSA  as a purely technical function  the community best
placed to manage the service is the TLD community that relies on it absolutely
for their own operations 
    The TLD community has an exemplary track record of collaborating on
technical matters solely for the public good  A good example is the response to
the Conficker worm  which saw almost all TLDs acting quickly  in unison and
without payment to block the domain names that were being registered by this
worm that threatened to infect a large proportion of home computers 
  Principle   - Delink
IANA globalization from broader ICANN
reforms
    The broader reforms aimed at balancing the views of governments  the private
sector and civil society and increasing the international engagement in the policy
around the 'root' are not problems that are going to be solved quickly  In the
proposal from IGP these problems remains but is now rightly restricted to the
reform of ICANN  which would set the policy for the root that DNSA would
be required to follow 
    The establishment of the DNSA would not in any way reduce the potential
scope of the oversight nor does it guarantee disproportionate influence to any
one state or other actor  All of the authority remains with the policy function 
rooted in the ICANN community 
  Other Matters
    InternetNZ supports efforts being made to meet the timetable set out in the
IGP paper  This would see the model being detailed and a demonstrable level of
support being available by the time that the current IANA contract expires (  
September     ) 
    InternetNZ prefers the ending of political oversight of the root as set out in the
model  but if as part of the transition the matter was a bottom line for some
stakeholders  we would not be concerned if a limited term extension of the
IANA contract between NTIA and the new DNSA was brought into being 
  Conclusion
    The IGP proposal rightly separates out technical function of root zone
administration from the policy making process  which should be the focus of
attention for governments and other stakeholders when considering the future
of Internet governance  It also provides a sensible and broadly workable plan
for the operation of that technical function 
    For those reasons InternetNZ supports in principle the proposal from the
Internet Governance Project 
    We look forward to being part of the conversation in São Paulo as the debate
proceeds 
With many thanks for your consideration 
Yours sincerely

Commonwealth Cybergovernance Model
   Introduction
     Recognising the central importance of the internet to Commonwealth members and
following the Abuja Declaration of Proposed Commonwealth Cybergovernance Model of  
October      and subsequent consultations  the Commonwealth Telecommunications
Organisation offers this draft set of principles for consideration and adoption during the
Commonwealth ICT Ministers Forum  The principles are intended to guide Commonwealth
members to plan and implement practical actions in policy development  regulation and
legislation  cross-border collaboration  capacity building  technical measures and other
operational activities 
   Cyberspace – the internet and more
     We are in an era of changing economic circumstances creating both opportunity
and uncertainty  giving rise to new trade and economic patterns together with unforeseen
threats to peace and security  and a surge in popular demands for democracy 
human rights and for broadened social and economic opportunities  Previously unimagined
access to information and communication between individuals across our planet is driving
economic and social development in the   st century  Cyberspace   provides this access 
helping us to bridge the digital divide while influencing every aspect of our economic and
social activities  Cyberspace is becoming our global central nervous system  Cyberspace
continues to develop at a pace unparalleled in our history - growth is anticipated from  bn
to  bn users by        many in developing countries  This pace of change necessitates
urgent action in reaching consensus on Cybergovernance 
     Its open  decentralised and distributed nature  that empowers the individual  has
fostered innovation  collaboration and rapid development  Enjoyment of those benefits
relies upon its safety  security and resilience  Cyberspace can also be a vehicle for crime 
extremism and other social ills   Governments  industry  civil society and users have a
shared responsibility  to tackle those threats to society  Necessary security measures may
be in tension with the very features that have made Cyberspace a success and  in
determining an equitable balance  our behaviour in Cyberspace will benefit from our
shared Commonwealth values that govern many aspects of our lives 
  Cyberspace encompasses the internet  mobile and fixed-line access  plus all the networked machine-to-machine
communications and other networked communications that are beyond the World Wide Web

   Applying Commonwealth values in Cyberspace
     The Commonwealth Charter of March      reflects the values and aspirations which
unite the Commonwealth - democracy  development  human rights and the rule of law 
The Charter expresses the commitment of member states to the development of free and
democratic societies and the promotion of peace and prosperity to improve the lives of all
peoples of the Commonwealth  It also acknowledges the role of civil society in supporting
the goals and values of the Commonwealth 
     The principles concerning our use of Cyberspace today and the evolving nature of
Cyberspace tomorrow should be derived from  should respect and reflect our shared
Commonwealth values as set out in the Commonwealth Charter  Within the context of the
Charter as a whole  we identify the key characteristics  which led to our principles  as
exemplified in Appendix    This analysis is based on the principle that what is
unacceptable off-line is unacceptable on-line  Priorities for practical action  in accordance
with these principles  will depend on the prevailing circumstances in each country 
   Commonwealth principles for the use of Cyberspace
     As we operate in Cyberspace and work with others to shape its continuing
development  we will use the following principles to guide our decisions  actions and
demonstrate our progress towards meeting these principles  The principles are best
considered collectively and not each in isolation without regard to the whole because
frequently some are in tension with each other  We reiterate the urgency with which these
issues need to be addressed 
Principle    We contribute to a safe and an effective global Cyberspace
  as a partnership between public and private sectors  civil society and users  a
collective creation 
  with multi-stakeholder  transparent and collaborative governance promoting
continuous development of Cyberspace 
  where investment in the Cyberspace is encouraged and rewarded 
  by providing sufficient neutrality of the network as a provider of information
services 
  by offering stability in the provision of reliable and resilient information services 
  by having standardisation to achieve global interoperability 
  by enabling all to participate with equal opportunity of universal access 
  as an open  distributed  interconnected internet 
  by providing an environment that is safe for its users  particularly the young and
vulnerable 
  made available to users at an affordable price 
Principle    Our actions in Cyberspace support broader economic and social
development
  by enabling innovation and sustainable development  creating greater coherence
and synergy  through collaboration and the widespread dissemination of
knowledge 
  respecting cultural and linguistic diversity without the imposition of beliefs 
  promoting cross-border delivery of services and free flow of labour in a multi-lateral
trading system 
  allowing free association and interaction between individuals across borders 
  supporting and enhancing digital literacy 
  providing everyone with information that promotes and protects their rights and is
relevant to their interests  for example to support transparent and accountable
government 
  enabling and promoting multi-stakeholder partnerships 
  facilitating pan-Commonwealth consultations and international linkages in a globally
connected space that also serves local interests 
Principle    We act individually and collectively to tackle cybercrime 
  nations  organisations and society work together to foster respect for the law 
  to develop relevant and proportionate laws to tackle Cybercrime effectively 
  to protect our critical national and shared infrastructures 
  meeting internationally-recognised standards and good practice to deliver security 
  with effective government structures working collaboratively within and between
states 
  with governments  relevant international organisations and the private sector
working closely to prevent and respond to incidents 
Principle    We each exercise our rights and meet our responsibilities in
Cyberspace
  we defend in Cyberspace the values of human rights  freedom of expression and
privacy as stated in our Charter of the Commonwealth 
  individuals  organisations and nations are empowered through their access to
knowledge 
  users benefit from the fruits of their labours  intellectual property is protected
accordingly 
  users can benefit from the commercial value of their own information  accordingly 
responsibility and liability for information lies with those who create it 
  responsible behaviour demands users all meet minimum Cyber hygiene
requirements 
  Cyber crime is an umbrella term frequently used to describe two distinct  but closely related criminal activities  cyberdependent
and cyber-enabled crimes  Use of the term Cybercrime reflects the particular difficulties arising in dealing with
criminal acts that make use of the internet and other ICTs including those crimes that cross jurisdictions  encountering
the juxtaposition of permissive laws and constraining laws  requiring cooperation between authorities in new ways  A
helpful elaboration  amongst others  can be found in a      UK Home office report  Cybercrime  a review of the
evidence  https   www gov uk government uploads system uploads attachment_data file        horr  -summary pdf 
  we protect the vulnerable in society in their use of Cyberspace 
  we  individually and collectively  understand the consequences of our actions and
our responsibility to cooperate to make the shared environment safe  our obligation
is in direct proportion to culpability and capability 
  Practical application of these principles
     Each Commonwealth member may find it beneficial to develop individually  a whole of
government strategy  reflecting the many facets in making Cyberspace safe  secure 
resilient and rewarding  that will address unique local needs of countries with their
different regions  sectors and industries and deliver their particular economic and social
priorities 
     Appendix   offers a guide to sample practical actions that can be taken by
Commonwealth members  based on these principles  Appendix   provides a list of
organisations offering practical guidance on Cybersecurity  Appendix   and    for guidance
only  are illustrative and new initiatives in this fast-moving topic may not be reflected 
Appendix    Implications for cyberspace of each element of the Commonwealth
Charter
a  Democracy
Our Charter says   We recognise the inalienable right of individuals to participate
in democratic processes  in particular through free and fair elections in shaping the society
in which they live     Used effectively  Cyberspace supports participative democracy  by
offering multiple channels for citizen’s engagement with the democratic process 
transparency and accountability of our governments  leading to good governance and a
fairer society 
b  Human Rights
Our Charter says   We are committed to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and
other relevant human rights covenants and international instruments  We are committed
to equality and respect for the protection and promotion of civil  political  economic  social
and cultural rights  including the right to development  for all without discrimination on
any grounds as the foundations of peaceful  just and stable societies     The operation of
Cyberspace could and should respect  reflect and protect these rights as they are applied
both online and offline  Widespread access to information through Cyberspace and the
network of stakeholders it could help build  equips societies to protect Human Rights 
while supporting individuals in their quest for dignified livelihoods 
c  International peace  security and economic development
Our Charter says   We firmly believe that international peace and security  sustainable
economic growth and development and the rule of law are essential to the progress and
prosperity of all  We are committed to an effective multilateral system based on
inclusiveness  equity  justice and international law     Whilst Cyberspace can give rise to
some new threats to global peace  it has a significant role to play in engendering
international peace by promoting understanding across cultures and communities  respect
for international law and adherence to accepted norms of behaviour  The contribution
Cyberspace could make to economic development is far more than the already significant
contribution it is making   The operation of an open and inclusive Cyberspace  while
recognising legitimate economic  security  cultural and social concerns of members  will
deliver these Charter outcomes 
d  Tolerance  respect and understanding
Our Charter says   We emphasise the need to promote tolerance  respect  understanding 
moderation and religious freedom which are essential to the development of free and
democratic societies  and recall that respect for the dignity of all human beings is critical
to promoting peace and prosperity  We accept that diversity and understanding the
richness of our multiple identities are fundamental to the Commonwealth’s principles and

  OECD report  The internet economy on the rise – progress since the Seoul Declaration  published     
approach   Cyberspace provides direct person-to-person social interactions   between
social  ethnic  religious and racial groups and thereby promotes respect for cultural and
linguistic diversity  encouraging social development  This can help   break down barriers of
ignorance  suspicion and prejudice  help protect the vulnerable poor  disabled and rural 
supporting these Charter outcomes 
e  Freedom of Expression
Our Charter says   We are committed to peaceful  open dialogue and the free flow of
information  including through a free and responsible media  and to enhancing democratic
traditions and strengthening democratic processes   Cyberspace provides the means for
unparalleled channels for the free flow of information  its evolution and operation must
continue to deliver the means for open and responsible dialogue 
f  Rule of Law
Our Charter says   We believe in the rule of law as an essential protection for the people
of the Commonwealth and as an assurance of limited and accountable government     Our
operation and use of Cyberspace must respect the law  the law must comply with
international norms  and the law must be capable of protecting the people and property 
As Cyberspace develops  Members must participate in the continued development of
norms of behaviour and laws 
g  Good Governance
Our Charter says   We reiterate our commitment to promote good governance through the
rule of law  to ensure transparency and accountability and to root out  both at national
and international levels  systemic and systematic corruption   Cyberspace can support
good governance of our countries through transparency and accountability of
government   and private sector activities  The governance of Cyberspace itself should in
turn be inclusive  transparent and accountable with the active participation of
governments  private sector and civil society 
h  Sustainable Development
Our Charter says   We recognise that sustainable development can help to eradicate
poverty by pursuing inclusive growth whilst preserving and conserving natural ecosystems
and promoting social equity  We stress the importance of sustainable economic and social
transformation to eliminate poverty and meet the basic needs of the vast majority of the
people of the world and reiterate that economic and social progress enhances the
sustainability of democracy

Cyberspace is a doorway to the global economy and an opportunity for less developed
states to participate in world markets  to develop new markets  and to commoditise their
resources  promoting economic development   
 We are committed to removing wide disparities and unequal living standards as guided by
internationally agreed development goals  We are also committed to building economic
resilience and promoting social equity  and we reiterate the value in technical assistance 
capacity building and practical cooperation in promoting development  We are committed
to an effective  equitable  rules-based multilateral trading system  the freest possible flow
of multilateral trade on terms fair and equitable to all  while taking into account the special
requirements of small states and developing countries  
Cyberspace can help find synergies with other development work and thereby bring
greater coherence to development initiatives  Through more universal access to
information and to markets  Cyberspace can help remove disparities of opportunity and
the means to bring these aspirations to fruition 
i  Protecting the Environment
Our Charter says   We recognise the importance of the protection and conservation of our
natural ecosystems and affirm that sustainable management of the natural environment is
the key to sustained human development  We recognise the importance of multilateral
cooperation  sustained commitment and collective action     The availability of previously
unparalleled amounts of sensory information  through Cyberspace  helps us better
manage   our environment and can reveal to the public eye any emerging damage   
j  Access to Health  Education  Food and Shelter
Our Charter says   We recognise the necessity of access to affordable health care 
education  clean drinking water  sanitation and housing for all citizens and emphasise the
importance of promoting health and well-being in combating communicable and noncommunicable
diseases   Access to information    reliable metrics   and delivery channels
offered by Cyberspace form a key part of delivering these outcomes  particularly for rural
communities 
k  Gender Equality
Our Charter says   We recognise that gender equality and women’s empowerment are
essential components of human development and basic human rights  The advancement
of women’s rights and the education of girls are critical preconditions for effective and
sustainable development   Cyberspace can contribute significantly to promoting gender
equality and equity  supporting Millennium      Development Goal    though this depends
upon access to ICT for women and girls  particularly in rural areas    Its nature as an open

l  Importance of Young People in the Commonwealth
Our Charter says   We recognise the positive and active role and contributions of young
people in promoting development  peace  democracy and in protecting and promoting
other Commonwealth values  such as tolerance and understanding  including respect for
other cultures     Young people  being digital natives  have embraced Cyberspace
wholeheartedly and come up with numerous innovations that have enriched Cyberspace   
Through education and guidance on the safe and effective use of Cyberspace  young
people will channel this dynamism and creativity into higher purposes  fostering wider
social understanding and triggering valuable innovation 
m  Recognition of the Needs of Small States
Our Charter says   We are committed to assisting small and developing states in the
Commonwealth  including the particular needs of small island developing states    
Cyberspace could help small island states surmount numerous challenges including paucity
of expertise  geographic isolation and economies of scale    Cyberspace offers a gateway
to global markets for small scale producers as much as for large scale producers  breaking
down one of the key barriers to market entry faced by small island states 
n  Recognition of the Needs of Vulnerable States
Our Charter says   We are committed to collaborating to find ways to provide immediate
help to the poorest and most vulnerable including least developed countries  and to
develop responses to protect the people most at risk   Cyberspace could help poorest 
most marginalised and vulnerable by providing access to information and to markets for
economic development 
o  The Role of Civil Society
Our Charter says   We recognise the important role that civil society plays in our
communities and countries as partners in promoting and supporting Commonwealth
values and principles     Cyberspace offers the means for easier and more effective
engagement by individuals in society  particularly the rural  the vulnerable and
marginalised  A more active civil society can help promote our values and principles in
today’s Cyberspace  A more active civil society can also stimulate further progress in
support of our values and principles by engaging directly in the development and
operation of tomorrow’s Cyberspace

   UNESCO-supported  Small Islands Voice  initiative and its Global Internet Forum and Internet based Youth Forum  See
also the reports of the  Small Islands Voice  meetings in Mauritius     
p  Cyberspace itself
Our Charter recognises the transformational role of Information and Communication
Technology  which underpins Cyberspace  and the need to harness its power in a positive
way   We also recognise the importance of information and communication technologies
as powerful instruments of development  delivering savings  efficiencies and growth in our
economies  as well as promoting education  learning and the sharing of culture  We are
committed to strengthening its use while enhancing its security  for the purpose of
advancing our societies  

The IEEE Standards Association (IEEE-SA)  a globally recognized standards-setting body within IEEE (www ieee org)  a large  global technical professional organization dedicated to advancing technology for the benefit of humanity and which embodies the OpenStand (open-stand org) principles for standards development  submits the following contribution in response to the request for views on  Internet governance principles  

The development and evolution of technologies upon which the Internet is based exemplifies the success of a bottom up  open system of standardization  The Internet evolved from a networking community to a global collection of communities and widespread information infrastructure that has resulted in today’s e-commerce  information and knowledge sharing and community operations  The standards and the technical foundation upon which the Internet was built  and continues to evolve upon and advance  were developed within a globally open  inclusive and decentralized paradigm that allows for diversity of opinions and approaches as well as flexibility to acknowledge and address change and varying needs 

The IEEE-SA believes that the principles associated with this paradigm—notably openness  transparency and inclusiveness—and the multi-stakeholder model of collaboration and consensus building can be applied to the principles for Internet governance to enable the successful progression of the Internet  including the progression and innovation of technology that serves as the foundation of the Internet 

Working within a framework of open participation and diversity  this paradigm applied to policy discussions and Internet Governance practices would help ensure the continuation of the open  universal and inclusive nature of the Internet via direct  informed knowledge contributions by the global  without national borders collective of developers and users of the Internet   Via collective empowerment the paradigm establishes a worldwide network capable of ensuring principles such as 

·       Direct participation meaning there are no intermediaries between a good idea and the peer group that decides the start of a best practice or policy  Everybody  from anywhere should be able to submit a proposal 

·       Due process providing for a level playing field for all participants to understand the rules of engagement and the opportunity for equal participation 

·       Broad consensus ensuring that decisions are made by either a majority or supermajority of participants  so no single person or entity wields undue power in the definition of a policy  

·       Balance in order to provide opportunity for a multitude of stakeholders to participate in the development of policies 

·       Transparency of the process and proceedings ensure that the procedures under which the policies are defined are available so that participants understand the rules of engagement and so that appropriate audit trails are available for inspection upon emergence of an output 

·      Universal openness from the very beginning of any policy dialogue or consultation to ensure that appropriate notification to a global audience is given to all potential stakeholders on a global basis regarding the opportunity to attend meetings  submission of comments and other relevant forms of engagement  This combined with transparency creates the basis for a robust and trustworthy policy development process 

The Internet technical community consists of individuals and organizations from around the
world that understand the global Internet as a complex interaction of technology  standards 
implementation  operation and application  They bring this expertise when working with
governments  national and international organizations  educational institutions  civil society
organizations  and private sector entities to maintain a technically viable Internet that can also
respond to societal needs  While participants have a wide range of missions and roles to play 
the Internet technical community shares a common culture that is grounded in a clear
understanding of the unique technical characteristics of the Internet  These
characteristics are essential to the Internet’s past  present  and future success as a platform
for advancing the economic and social well-being of all of its users 
In a remarkably short period of time  the Internet has evolved from a research effort to test the
then-new theories of computer networking to a powerful  pervasive  and now indispensable
tool for global communication  business innovation  government  social networking and the
activities of daily life  Even those who were responsible for the technical choices that provided
the foundation for that evolution have different perspectives on how much of today's Internet
and its impact were anticipated and intentional  and how much was fortunate and
unplanned  Regardless of how this history is interpreted  many of the early technology and
architecture choices that created the Internet that we know today were made as integral 
original elements of the network itself  They remain essential to the Internet as a complex 
multi-dimensional system  In particular  the network operates with only the minimal central
authority required for essential coordination  allowing for the autonomy and growth of
constituent networks 
To avoid compromising the Internet’s technical core functions and processes  the policy
debates of Internet governance would benefit from being informed by the experience and
insight of those who have been directly responsible for developing and operating it  The
principles that have promoted and sustained the development of the Internet since its
inception — the open and inclusive process for developing Internet protocols and standards 
the impartial stewardship of Internet naming and addressing resources  and the decentralized
cooperation and collaboration of network operators around the globe — are the Internet
technical community's critical contribution to these debates 
The Internet technical community is an indispensable stakeholder and contributor to the
global Internet governance dialogue  The organizations and individuals in this community have
had over four decades of cumulative experience in creating  improving  deploying  and
managing the Internet in almost all countries of the world  under a wide variety of legal 
administrative  and regulatory regimes  We are concerned that the technical viability of the
global Internet is at risk unless the current Internet governance discussions lead to a
consensus that preserves the essential principles that have contributed to making the Internet
we have today 
The impact of different governance regimes on the Internet as a robust and remarkably
generative connectivity infrastructure may not be evident to those who are not familiar with its
history  do not have an expert understanding of its technology  or have not had direct
experience with its deployment and operation  As a contribution to the global Internet
governance dialogue  the following recommendations are made by individuals and
organizations to whom  by virtue of their involvement in the technical development and
deployment of the Internet those potential impacts are evident 
Recommendations
The openness and transparency of Internet policy and technical development processes are
intrinsic to the success of the Internet itself  which depends on a global and interoperable
fabric of information and communications technology and the people who operate and use it 
We recognize that the multi-stakeholder model of decision-making  articulated around the
following principles and practices  has proven to be the most effective model of governance for
the Internet’s technical development  and has the potential to enhance and reinforce future
Internet evolution 
A  Open and inclusive participation  Participation in Internet technical
development and operation  including technical standards development and allocation
of the Internet number resources  is open to all interested and informed parties  This
has been key for the Internet’s success  Participation of all interested and informed
stakeholders in governance processes is necessary to ensure that outcomes are
accepted as legitimate and that solutions are effective 
B  Consensus-based  The development of Internet technical standards and
processes is done on the basis of open consensus  This allows for all views to be
considered  and agreement to be found across a range of interests  Internet
governance decisions should also be grounded on open  transparent  and collaborative
work  Policy-making processes should be informed by individual and collective
expertise and practical experience  and decisions should be arrived at by open
consensus rather than as a result of a voting process 
C  Permission-less innovation  The remarkable growth of the Internet  the
fostering of innovation and its uses follows directly from the open model of Internet
connectivity and standards development  No central authority should be established  as
part of any future Internet governance arrangement that would constrain or regulate the
ability of individuals or organizations to create and use new standards  applications  or
services 
D  Collective stewardship and empowerment  Strong notions of equity and
fairness among participants mark the technical development of the Internet  The
success of Internet development and operation is secured by the recognition of
respective roles and responsibilities by Internet community members who cooperate 
respectful of each organization’s autonomy  integrity  and processes  To ensure the
continued security  stability  and resilience of the Internet  governance structures and
principles must be developed in an environment of strong cooperation among all
stakeholders  each contributing a perspective informed by their respective roles and
responsibilities 
E  Transparency  Internet technical standards bodies and operating entities function
in a transparent way  They provide advance public notice of proposed activities  which
describes the scope of work to be undertaken and the conditions for participation  The
principle of transparency assures that all interested stakeholders can directly observe
the work being done and have access to its results 
F  Pragmatic and evidence-based approach  In the technical world  solutions
are chosen and defined based on technical merit  judged according to the collective
expertise of all participants  Processes are driven by the ability to devise practical
solutions to concrete problems  based upon informed discussion  We observe that lack
of clarity in emerging issues in Internet governance results in incomplete agreement
about how to address the problem  In this spirit  Internet governance discussions and
debates must be informed by and depend upon objective and empirical information 
G  Voluntary adoption  Internet standards and processes are voluntarily adopted by
network operators  equipment manufacturers  and other infrastructure participants  and
their success is determined in the marketplace  In the realm of Internet technical policy
development  the principle of voluntarism means that success is determined by users
and the public at large rather than by any central authority 
As the Internet evolves in the future  its continued security  stability  accessibility and
usefulness will grow to be even more important to support most critical aspects of human
activity  The above recommendations are our contribution to this effort  based upon the
Internet technical community’s long term and intensive involvement in the technical
development  deployment and operation of the Internet 

One of the barriers to accepting free standing multistakeholder governance organizations is oversight   Accountability requires that there be oversight   But how can oversight be done in a bottom-up multistakeholder organization without inflicting external control  for example the so-called new space  upon the bottom up multistakeholder organizations 

 

Often  as soon as the word ‘oversight’ is mentioned governments jump in and assert themselves as the ultimate overseers of all things related to Internet public policy   From the point of view of the multistakeholder models of international  participatory democracy  it is impossible to accept government oversight of multistakeholder organizations   If one stakeholder group is solely responsible for oversight  the group becomes a unistakeholder entity  no matter what appearance those running around at the bottom of the organization might give   Government oversight of multistakholder organizations would destroy their multistakeholder character 

 

There are  however  methods by which organizations do create bottom-up oversight  Some like the IETF have multiple levels of appeal on every decision  where the decisions of working groups are can be appealed to the Internet Engineering Steering Group (IESG)  a group chosen by a multistakeholder Nominating Committee (Nomcom) and approved by the Internet Architecture Board (IAB)  itself having been chosen by the multistakeholder Nomcom and approved by the Internet Society (ISOC) Board of Trustees   The dissatisfied appellant can further appeal a decision by the IESG to the IAB   Since the IESG and the IAB have very different mandates from the community  it would be a mistake to think that the IAB rubber stamps the decisions of the IESG  anyone who has observed the relations between these groups only has to recall IETF history to know that relations have not always been warm or even cordial   

 

In case the appeals process is somehow perverted  the IAB decision can be further appealed to the Board of Trustees of ISOC on process issues  a group that is chosen by a combination of nominating committees and votes in the various stakeholder groups that make up the Internet Society   Each of these appeals and results is published transparently for the entire Internet community to read  in a manner that allows comment on the IETF list   Each of these appeals can be discussed in the open plenaries held three times a year  if so desired by the community   Anyone who has ever followed the IETF list or an IETF plenary knows how vox populi can be quite persuasive in this environment  The history of the IETF shows that  on occasion  it has persuaded either the IESG or the IAB to reconsider its decisions    It should be noted that there are also methods within the IETF for recall of the members of the IESG and the IAB  A chain of transparent appeals such as this  with a strong public voice is one form of bottom-oversight that has been shown to work   A series of public and transparent appeals are  in fact  one of the tools that any organization can use to provide oversight 

 

The Affirmation of Commitments between the US Department of Commerce and the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (AOC) establishes a new method for bottom-up oversight of a multistakeholder organization   This process is entering its  th year   I had the privilege of being part of the second Accountability and Transparency Review Team (ATRT ) that is stipulated in the process and write the following from my personal experience as a member of that group 

 

As outlined in the AOC  each of the Support Organizations and Advisory Committee nominates several members to the various review teams  transparency and accountability  the security and stability of the names and number systems  competition and consumer trust  and registrant directory operations compliance with international laws and norms (aka WHOIS)   From the candidates presented by the various stakeholder groups  the Chair of the Board or the CEO  depending on the team  and the Chair of the Government Advisory Committee (GAC) pick a review team   To this group they add a few experts to balance out the mix of skills   While not everyone is happy about the selection process and it does seem to favor governmental actors  at last in terms of the ATRT  it is by and large a process accepted by the community   The groups work together for approximately a year to produce their reports   They are served by a group of professional ICANN staff and are constrained by an ICANN Board determined budget   The ATRT  report discusses how this is occasionally an impediment to the group being able to do as complete a job as might be hoped 

 

These reviews run in a   year cyclical manner with the ATRT running every third year  for a year  Currently ICANN is in the second cycle of AOC reviews   Each of these reviews provides the opportunity for multiple public consultations and several public reviews of the work in progress   The final reports are published in multiple languages and opened for a final public review before the ICANN Board receives them   The Board then reviews the reports  and the comments and  with the advice of Staff  decides how it will respond to the reports   By the time the Board acts  the review teams have been disbanded  The results of Board and Staff actions are reviewed by the next review teams 

 

In addition to reviewing the state of transparency and accountability in ICANN  ATRT is responsible for reviewing the way in which ICANN had responded to the previous AOC reviews and for reviewing any changes that had been made in response to the previous ATRT review  It should be noted that review team reports only recommend actions to the Board  which the Board is able to accept or not to accept   Any refusal by the Board or ICANN staff to implement the changes requested is subject to review by the next review team as the cycle repeats   That is  ATRT  will review the changes made since ATRT   just as ATRT  reviewed the changes since ATRT  

 

The ATRT  report gives a very detailed description in its review of both the  state of the organization and the degree to which ICANN complied with the first cycle’s reviews   The determination was mixed  with many changes only being made as the ATRT  review was ongoing   Some progress had been made  but not as much as the first ATRT review had recommended   As ATRT  second report is still in review until    March       the Board has not had much opportunity to act on it yet  though to its credit it has started working on some of the items in anticipation 

 

For a bottom-up review mechanism like the AOC to work  those responsible for the organization must take the report and the obligation to accept and implement the recommendations seriously   Whether this is the case for ICANN  remains to be seen  and will be part of the proof of whether this is a workable method   According to a blog piece by the President of ICANN  Staff has every intention of completing the necessary changes 

 

There are other requirements for such a bottom-up review process to work   One of the handicaps ATRT  experienced was the need to start its review process from a blank sheet   We had to request reports from ICANN on every issue  including those that had been documented in the first ATRT report   We were also unable to build upon any of the research and data collection that had been done by the first review and in the intervening reviews as that data had not been retained and processes had not been continued  During the ATRT  review  several research efforts  for example  research on the policy development process and on measurement practices were undertaken   It is to be hoped that that the data from these will be available to ATRT  so that the team will not need to again start from a blank page and will be able to look at longitudinal trends in ICANN’s transparency and accountability   Continuity of bottom-up oversight enables a better view of an organization and thus better accountability 

 

To do a complete and thorough review  a review team needs full access to organization data   This is sometimes difficult as the team needs to know what data is available in order to ask for it   In order to do an adequate review it is better to have an organization anticipate and offer the necessary information as opposed to having a gate in the process that only gives the team information when it is correctly requested and the request has been approved up the corporate and legal chain of command   ICANN has tended toward the gating methodology as opposed to an anticipatory and open method of offering data  though for the most part after a bit of pushing and pulling  the necessary information was obtained 

 

ICANN is settling into the process of ongoing AOC reviews  The process needs improvement  and the ATRT  report contains recommendations for how this can be done   For a more in depth review  readers can consult the ATRT  Transparency and Accountability review   In my view the method shows promise yet to be fully delivered on 

 

The strongest bottom-up oversight would be achieved by combining the methods of the IETF and ICANN   IETF offers a strong appeals mechanism and the ability to remove officers from their roles if they do not fulfill the responsibilities   ICANN has a very weak appeals mechanism  in fact an review and repair of that mechanism was recommended by both ATRT  and ATRT    ICANN processes allow for review of Board decisions  but only for process infractions  there is no means of request a review within ICANN of a decision on a substantive basis as can be done in the IETF   And while there is an Independent Review Process for Board decisions and Staff actions  it is reputed to require a deposit in the order of a million dollars and can only deliver a decision in favor of the appellant if malfeasance of some other bad faith effort can be proven   ICANN has no mechanism for removing Board members for the manner in which they fulfill their responsibilities other than not to renew their   year terms for a second or third time (ICANN Board members can serve a maximum of   consecutive years)   

 

ICANN on the other hand offers an innovative set of bottom up community reviews  whereas the IETF only initiates reviews of its processes when there is an indication that the process is somehow broken using the ‘if it isn’t broken don’t fix it’ philosophy   It has  over the years initiated several working groups to review its processes when the community felt there was a problem  I had the opportunity of chairing one of its Nominating committee review working groups   The recommendations of this WG were accepted and implemented 

 

Bottom-up oversight of multistakeholder organizations is possible   No method is perfect and use of several methods  the so-called belt and suspenders method  gives an organization its best chance of being accountable to its community without needing to resort to a governmental and hierarchical form of oversight   An additonal element that might be consdered as part of any bottom-up oversight mechansim is affordable access to an independent mediation borad for issues that can't be resolved in any other manner 

 

Moving forward  no new spaces are required to oversee organizations such as IETF and ICANN  though both can improve their bottom-up methodologies by borrowing elements from the other   An activity that would be helpful would be for workshops to be held within the IGF context on the various methodologies of bottom-up multistakeholder oversight and review so that organizations would be able to learn from each others experiences  

 

The practice of bottom-up multistakeholder review is young  but has a promising future 

The Internet Society appreciates the opportunity to provide input for consideration by the
participants in the Global Multistakeholder Meeting on the Future of Internet Governance
( NETmundial ) 
We understand that the meeting will seek to put forward a set of recommended principles on
Internet governance  In this regard  the Internet Society considers openness as a core
principle and the underlying foundation for the fulfillment  enjoyment and sustainability of the
Internet’s social  political and economic potential 
Openness is additionally reflected in the following principles  articulated by a set of Internet
standard-setting organizations 
  Cooperation among standards organizations 
  Adherence to due process  broad consensus  transparency  balance and openness in
standards development 
  Commitment to technical merit  interoperability  competition  innovation and benefit to
humanity 
  Availability of standards to all  and
  Voluntary adoption 
Underlying these principles is the value openness has created for the Internet (and beyond) 
Internet standards have to be open to be useable  Openness allows the rapid development of
the Internet and the various applications running on it  it has resulted in unprecedented
economic growth  social transformation  technological innovation and creativity 
The Virtuous Circle of an Open Internet
Openness has allowed the technical  economic  societal and political dimensions of the
Internet to come closer together  For instance  open global standards provide a platform for
borderless trade and an interoperable open economy  fostering innovation  innovation  in turn 
relies on users’ ability to freely and openly create  share information and exchange ideas 
reflecting the model of a healthy open society  finally  open multistakeholder models have
proven key in terms of economic development and capacity building 
In the absence of open  global standards for interoperation  fragmented and incompatible
networks are likely  Open standards are accessible to all developers and permit the creation
of affordable networks and services  through competition  The desire to create an open and
efficient system of communication has driven the creation of the Internet we see today 
Openness can also enhance individuals’ freedom  allowing people to connect and craft
together technical and social change through a participatory and consensus-driven process 
From its early days  the Internet has evolved by empowering users and communities 
Final remarks
These manifestations of openness  however  require constant commitment and re-examination
of core values to remain relevant and effective  The NETMundial meeting could be one of the
spaces that contribute towards this commitment 
For more than    years  the Internet Society has been committed  to promote the open
development  evolution  and use of the Internet for the benefit of all people throughout the
world   
To this end  the Internet Society considers openness a key principle  It is because of openness
that the need to adhere to other principles including  but not limited to  transparency 
accountability  cooperation  inclusiveness  proportionality and the rule of law and due process
becomes even more pertinent  Openness encapsulates the essence of the Internet – from its
technical evolution to its contribution to societies and economies 

As per disseminated in the OpenStand movement (www openstand org)  the Modern
Paradigm for Global Standards Development is shaped by adherence to the following five
principles 
   Cooperation  Respectful cooperation between standards organizations  whereby each
respects the autonomy  integrity  processes  and intellectual property rules of the others 
   Adherence to principles  Adherence to the five fundamental principles of
standards development 
  Due process  Decisions are made with equity and fairness among participants  No
one party dominates or guides standards development  Standards processes are
transparent and opportunities exist to appeal decisions  Processes for periodic
standards review and updating are well defined 
  Broad consensus  Processes allow for all views to be considered and addressed 
such that agreement can be found across a range of interests 
  Transparency  Standards organizations provide advance public notice of proposed
standards development activities  the scope of work to be undertaken  and conditions
for participation  Easily accessible records of decisions and the materials used in
reaching those decisions are provided  Public comment periods are provided before
final standards approval and adoption 
  Balance  Standards activities are not exclusively dominated by any particular
person  company or interest group 
  Openness  Standards processes are open to all interested and informed parties 
   Collective empowerment  Commitment by affirming standards organizations and
their participants to collective empowerment by striving for standards that 
  are chosen and defined based on technical merit  as judged by the contributed
expertise of each participant 
  provide global interoperability  scalability  stability  and resiliency 
  enable global competition 
  serve as building blocks for further innovation  and
  contribute to the creation of global communities  benefiting humanity 
   Availability  Standards specifications are made accessible to all for implementation and
deployment  Affirming standards organizations have defined procedures to develop
specifications that can be implemented under fair terms  Given market diversity  fair terms
may vary from royalty-free to fair  reasonable  and non-discriminatory terms (FRAND) 
   Voluntary adoption  Standards are voluntarily adopted and success is determined by
the market 

This paper offers a brief introduction to some of the Internet organizations and processes that
shape naming and addressing  shared global services and operations  and open standards
development in the Internet ecosystem  It builds on the Internet Society’s well-received
graphic  The Internet Ecosystem

The Importance of Participation
A diverse set of players has shaped the Internet and continues to contribute to its future
success  Yet the Internet is not a static thing  Since it was established as a research network
more than    years ago  it has evolved from a small government-run network of researchers to
a network of networks that is the cornerstone for the global economy and an indispensable
tool for individuals worldwide 
These phenomenal changes pose significant challenges for policy processes and actors in the
Internet policy field  The organizations and processes that shape Internet policy have proven
to be resilient and adaptable in large part because they have assumed that change is a
constant and because they recognize that the best solutions to new issues that arise stem
from willing collaboration between informed stakeholders 
The Internet Society encourages all stakeholders to become involved in the policy and
standardization processes that support the ongoing evolution of the Internet and the equally
evolving management of Internet resources 
Within the Internet ecosystem  various organizations have responsibilities for the protocols and
standards that enable basic end-to-end communications (such as the Internet Protocol)  the
resources that direct these communications (such as IP addresses and the Domain Name
System)  the provision of reliable connectivity that ensures the communications reach their
intended destinations  thus linking end-users (such as global telecommunication  satellite and
cable system operators  Internet Exchange Points  etc )  and the policies  frameworks and
educational activities necessary to ensure the Internet’s openness  continuity and flexibility 
These technologies  resources and services are all highly interdependent and require a
significant amount of coordination  The organizations responsible for standardization 
coordination  administration and day-to-day management in the Internet sphere include the
IETF  ICANN  the IANA function  the RIRs  and many others that will be touched upon in this
paper  Each organization has a specific role and provides fundamental value to the overall
functioning of the Internet 
These organizations have a proven  long-standing relationship with one another in
coordinating the technical infrastructure of the Internet and have contributed to its incredible
growth and stability  They make use of well-established mechanisms  including open  public
meetings  mailing lists and bottom-up policy development processes that enable direct
participation by any interested party  This way of working ensures that policies are defined by
those who require them for their operations  It also gives the system the flexibility to respond
and adapt to the Internet’s rapidly evolving technology and to the changing needs of the
Internet community  It has resulted in the creation of a significant body of knowledge and
experience in the successful administration and management of the technologies  resources
and services that make the Internet the success it is today 
The development  governance and coordination of the Internet result from discussions 
debates and policy development processes in many specialized forums  Active participation by
end users  governments  business  civil society and technical experts (whether as individuals
or organizational representatives) is essential to make the policies  approve the procedures
and write the standards  etc   that make the Internet the efficient and effective system it is
today 
The Internet Society is pleased to offer this guide to the Internet stakeholders  their policy
processes and participation mechanisms related to naming and addressing  shared global
services and operations and open standards development within the Internet Ecosystem  It is
hoped that this paper helps encourage and facilitate participation in these important areas of
Internet policy development 
The Internet Ecosystem
Internet ecosystem is the term used to describe the organizations and communities that have
organically evolved to guide the operation and development of the technologies and
infrastructure that comprise the global Internet  These organizations share common values
and a shared commitment to the open development of the Internet 
The term Internet ecosystem implies a Darwinian evolution focusing on the rapid and
continued development and adoption of Internet technologies and which is characterized by
the involvement of a broad range of actors  open  transparent  and collaborative processes 
and the use of products and infrastructure with dispersed ownership and control 
Organizations that comprise the Internet Ecosystem include 
! Technical standards bodies such as the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF)  the
World Wide Web Consortium (W C)  and the Institute of Electrical and Electronic
Engineers (IEEE)
! Organizations that manage resources for global naming and addressing capabilities such
as the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN)  including its
operation of the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) function  Regional Internet
Registries (RIR)  and Doman Name Registries and Registrars
! Companies that provide network infrastructure services such as Domain Name Service
(DNS) providers  network operators  cloud and content delivery network providers  and
Internet Exchange Points (IXPs)
! Individuals and Organizations that use the Internet to communicate with each other and
offer services and applications  or develop content  and
! Organizations that provide education and build capacity for developing and using Internet
technologies  such as multilateral organizations  educational institutions  and
governmental agencies 
This paper looks at each component of the Internet ecosystem in turn 
Naming and Addressing
Focus Areas 
! Internet Protocol (IP) Addresses
! Generic Top Level Domains (gTLDs)
Internet Protocol Addresses (IP Addresses)
Background
Internet Protocol (IP) addresses are unique numeric identifiers that are needed by every
device that connects to the global Internet  The numeric identifier is assigned to a device or
end point that enables data to be accurately transported between origination and destination
points within a network or networks  IP addresses are a shared common resource that must
be managed carefully and consistently to ensure the continued growth and stability of the
Internet 
Players
IANA
The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) maintains registries of unique
codes and numbers that are used in the technical standards ( protocols ) that drive
the Internet  IANA’s activities can be broadly grouped in to three categories 
Domain Names
IANA manages the Domain Name System (DNS) Root zone  the  int and  arpa
domains  and an Internationalized Domain Names (IDN) language table registry 
http   www iana org domains
Number Resources
IANA coordinates the global pool of unicast IP addresses and Autonomous System
(AS) numbers  providing them to Regional Internet Registries 
http   www iana org numbers 
Protocol Assignments
Other numbers  names and resources for Internet protocols developed by the
Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) are maintained in IANA-managed registries
under the direction of the IETF  http   www iana org protocols
The IANA function is performed by ICANN under contract with the United States
Department of Commerce 
ICANN
The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) has
responsibility for unicast Internet Protocol (IP) address space allocation (through
IANA)  and the operation and evolution of the Domain Name System  along with the
coordination of policy development reasonably and appropriately related to these
technical functions  http   www icann org en about
ASO
The ICANN Address Supporting Organization (ASO) was established by means of a
Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between the Numbering Resource
Organization (NRO) and ICANN  This MoU establishes that the NRO fulfills the role 
responsibilities  and functions of the ASO as defined within the ICANN Bylaws 
The functions of the ASO are carried out by the ASO Address Council (ASO AC) 
whose members are elected and appointed by their respective RIR communities  Its
purpose is to review and development of recommendations on Internet number
resource policy and to advise the ICANN board  http   aso icann org 
NRO
The NRO is composed of the   Regional Internet Registries (RIRs)  The purpose of
the Number Resource Organization is to ensure global coherence of certain RIR
activities  and to provide a single common interface to all the RIRs where this is
necessary  The NRO also undertakes joint RIR activities  including technical
projects and liaison activities  http   www nro net 
RIR
The five Regional Internet Registries (RIRs) are responsible  within their respective
regions  for allocating Internet number resources such as globally unique IP
addresses (IPv  and IPv ) and autonomous system numbers  These resources are
required by Internet service providers and users to identify elements of the basic
Internet infrastructure such as interfaces on routers  switches and computers   RIRs
hold open policy forums to discuss and establish regional policies for number
allocation

The Latin American and Caribbean Internet Addresses Registry (LACNIC) 
http   www lacnic net 
The Réseaux IP Européens Network Coordination Centre (RIPE NCC) 
http   www ripe net 
NIR
A National Internet Registry (NIR) primarily allocates address space obtained from
the relevant RIR  consistent with RIR policies  to its members or constituents  which
are typically LIRs ISPs  A limited number of NIRs exist in the Asia and Latin
American and Caribbean regions  
  http   www nro net about internet-registries html
  For a full list  http   en wikipedia org wiki National_Internet_registry
LIR
A Local Internet Registry (LIR) is typically an Internet Service
Provider (ISP)  which assigns address space to users of its network services (who
may be other ISPs  which then assign address space to their own customers)  
ISPs
Internet Service providers  
IP Address Allocation Process
The allocation of unicast Internet Protocol addresses is undertaken by IANA  in accordance
with the IP specification laid out by IETF specifications 
Requests for IP addresses are typically made by LIRs (usually an ISP) either to the
appropriate Regional Internet Registry (RIR)  or  in limited cases  to the National Internet
Registry (NIR) – if any such exist in the particular jurisdiction  (The LIRs and NIRs also receive
their allocations from the RIR in their particular region )  
As an RIR completes allocations from the space it has been given from IANA  the RIR will
request a new allocation from IANA  Once IANA has determined that the request meets
various clearly defined conditions (agreed on in global policy)  the allocation is made to the
RIR  IANA does not make allocations directly to ISPs  LIRs and NIRs 
For an in-depth review of the RIRs and the evolution of address allocation policy 
http   www internetsociety org fine-balance-internet-number-resource-distribution-and-decentralisation
Whether an ISP requests addresses from an RIR or an RIR requests a new block of
addresses from IANA  there must be a demonstrated need for the request to be granted  The
allocation processes outlined above are clearly defined in policy documents agreed between
the RIRs and ICANN (as the responsible party for IANA’s operations)  These documents are
listed below

addresses  are governed by a MoU between the Internet Engineering Task force (IETF) and
ICANN  MoU Concerning the Technical Work of the IANA  http   tools ietf org html rfc    
IP Address Policy Processes
Unicast IP addresses are allocated based on policies that are proposed and agreed through
bottom-up and open consultation mechanisms  The RIRs  NIRs  ISPs and end users allocate 
assign and use IP addresses  Two additional policy-focused entities are also involved in policy
development for IP address distribution  the NRO and the ICANN ASO (Address Supporting
Organization) 
Regional IP address allocation policy development usually begins when an individual or
organization submits an idea to an RIR  RIRs host open policy forums and mailing lists to
discuss these ideas and establish regional policies for Internet number delegation  While the
RIR policy development processes may differ slightly across the regions  they are based upon
the principles of openness  transparency and deliberation  and any individual or organization
can participate  
Global policy proposals that affect how the RIRs receive resources from IANA also start as
policy ideas submitted to the RIR policy forums  For a policy to be declared global  it has to be
one that affects all five RIRs and IANA 
Global policy proposals are discussed within each of the RIR communities  When each RIR
community adopts the same proposal (minor word differences that don’t change the meaning
are acceptable)  the proposal is then forwarded to the ASO  The ASO then communicates the
proposal to the ICANN Board and  once the Board has accepted  the proposal becomes global
policy and is formally published on the NRO and ICANN websites

discussed in the following section 
How to Participate in IP Address Allocation Policy Processes
Interested individuals and organizations can follow and participate in IP address allocation
policy development through the RIRs’ open meetings  policy development processes and
forum mailing lists  ICANN’s public meetings  and through the open ASO  mailing lists 
Government representatives are encouraged to participate directly in the RIR policy process 
and several do  In addition  they can also be informed of recent developments in IP address
allocation discussions through the ICANN’s Governmental Advisory Committee (GAC) via the
NRO report  http   gac icann org 
Additionally  government representatives can and do participate in the RIR and ICANN open
meetings and subscribe to their open mailing lists  Some RIRs also hold specific roundtable
meetings focused on issues of interest to governments and regulators   
While participation in the IP address allocation policy is important  participation in the uptake
and transition to IPv  is equally so  Most of the Internet is currently addressed via IP version  
(IPv ) addresses  IPv  addresses are also increasingly used  but not yet to the same extent 
IPv  is a more recent protocol  offering a much larger address pool than IPv   The deployment
of IPv  does not mean that the whole Internet switches over to IPv  on some specified date 
rather the deployment is a process during which the new protocol will increasingly be adopted 
During the deployment both protocols will coexist  At some future time  IPv  is expected to be
the dominant IP version  and IPv  use will drop off 
This deployment of IPv  is becoming increasingly critical as the IPv  address pool is running
out and the time to implement IPv  in networks is now  The deployment is taking place  thanks
to a concerted effort that is growing across the Internet ecosystem  For example  with World
IPv  Day  hosted by the Internet Society  major web companies and other industry players
came together to enable IPv  on their main websites for    hours  The goal was to motivate
organizations across the industry — Internet service providers  hardware makers  operating
system vendors and web companies — to prepare their services for IPv  to ensure a
successful transition as IPv  address space runs out  In       the World IPv  Launch took
place  with many more Internet service providers (ISPs)  home networking equipment
manufacturers  and Web companies around the world permanently deploying IPv  for their
Board's Review Procedures for Global Internet Number Resource Policies  http   www icann org en news in-focus globaladdressing

products and services  Between World IPv  Day and the World IPv  Launch  IPv  use around
the world doubled  and it doubled again by one year later in       These efforts demonstrate
what can be achieved through the collective and collaborative action within the Internet
ecosystem

Generic Top Level Domain Names
Background
A generic top-level domain (gTLD) is one of a number of different types of top-level domains
(TLDs) maintained by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) for use in the Domain
Name System of the Internet  These categories include  among others  generic top level
domains (gTLD) and country code top level domains (ccTLD)  A domain name is a way of
making an Internet Protocol address (a series of numbers and dots) more comprehensible to
users  Typical gTLDs that we are all familiar with include  com   net   org  etc 
Two recent developments that are touched upon in this paper that have been the product of
extensive policy deliberation are the introduction of new gTLDs and the introduction of
internationalized ccTLDs and internationalized gTLDs 
Actors in the ICANN gTLD Policy Process
GNSO
The Generic Names Supporting Organization (GNSO) is the main policy-making
body of ICANN for gTLDs  http   gnso icann org 
CSG
The GNSO’s Commercial Stakeholder Group (CSG) represents the views of small
businesses  business organizations  Internet connectivity providers  intellectual
property owners and intellectual property organizations  CSG is official represented
at ICANN by the following constituencies  Commercial business users  Intellectual
property interests  and Internet service providers 
http   gnso icann org en about stakeholders-constituencies csg
NCSG
The Non-commercial Stakeholder Group (NCSG) in the GNSO is the home for civil
society organizations  individuals and non-for-profit organizations within ICANN 
NCSG is officially represented at ICANN by the following constituencies  a) Non-
Commercial Users Constituency (NCUC)  and  b) the Non-for Profit Operational
Constituency  http   gnso icann org en about stakeholders-constituencies ncsg
gTLD Registries Stakeholder Group
The gTLD Registries constituency represents those organizations running gTLD
registries within the GNSO  http   gnso icann org en about stakeholdersconstituencies 
rysg
Registrar Stakeholder Group
The registrar constituency represents companies that register domains for Internet
users for a fee within the GNSO  http   gnso icann org en about stakeholdersconstituencies 
rrsg
Structure of gTLD Policy Process
gTLD policy discussions are typically initiated by or within ICANN’s Generic Names Supporting
Organization (GNSO) following input from its six  stakeholder  communities  the Commercial
Stakeholder Group (Commercial Business Users  Intellectual Property  Internet Service
Providers  the Non-Commercial Stakeholder Group (Non-Commercial Users  Not-for-Profit
Operational Concerns)  Registry Stakeholder Group (those that manage the TLDs)  Registrar
Stakeholder Group  Nominating Committee Appointees and Liaisons  Board Appointees and
NomCom Appointees  Information on the structure of the GNSO can be found at 
http   gnso icann org en about structures     
Each of these stakeholder groups has its respective policy processes to allow positions to be
submitted to the GNSO Council for review  For further details of memberships and policy
processes it is recommended that the reader visit the relevant stakeholder group website (see
above)  Each of these stakeholder groups elects representatives to the GNSO Council 
The GNSO has a policy development process that is outlined in ICANN’s bylaws    The ICANN
Board  the GNSO Council or an ICANN Advisory Committee (GAC  ALAC  SSAC  RSSAC)  
may raise issues for consideration within the policy development process of the GNSO 
Typically the GNSO will meet with the Advisory Committees  notably the GAC  during each
ICANN meeting to inform and encourage discussion  Once the issue has satisfied the
necessary requirements the policy development process (PDP) can begin 
Once a proposal has passed through the GNSO’s PDP and has the recommendation of the
GNSO Council it is submitted to the ICANN Board for approval 
The New gTLD Policy
In       agreement was reached in ICANN for the introduction of new gTLDs  The largest new
gTLD process to date is now in its final stages and some new gTLDs have already been
added to Root Zone file  ICANN is expected to add many more in      and  after a review of
the process  may hold additional rounds

How to Participate in gTLD Policy Processes
The gTLD landscape is changing and the introduction of new gTLDs and Internationalized
Domain Names should encourage a greater number of stakeholders to participate in the
associated policy processes 
As an interested individual one can follow and participate in the policy discussions through
ICANN’s public comment webpage where all the substantive pieces of work of a policy nature
(and more) are listed and open to comment   
   GNSO policy development process  http   www icann org en general bylaws htm#AnnexA
   ICANN Advisory Committees overview  http   www icann org en structure 
   http   www icann org en public-comment 
For a more in-depth engagement  interested individuals can join the constituency representing
their particular interest  For example  those involved in civil society organizations or not-forprofit
organizations  or who are interested in participating as individuals could decide to join
the non-commercial stakeholder group (NCSG)  http   gnso icann org en about stakeholdersconstituencies 
ncsg
Organizations have an opportunity to participate in the various ICANN supporting structures
(through the constituencies outlined above)  This requires a greater level of engagement  but
for those organizations that are involved in or have a material interest in the domain name
space participation is important 
Many representative organizations participate in the ICANN processes  It is not essential 
therefore  to participate directly  although a decision whether to do so will of course depend
upon the importance of ICANN deliberations to the organization in question  The International
Chamber of Commerce in the GNSO’s CSG is an example of a representative association that
participates in the ICANN GNSO and many other forums    Many other national  regional or
international associations participate in ICANN processes  and these provide a useful first
entry point for individuals and organizations that are new to the world of gTLD policy 
And  as with IP address allocation  governments will typically participate directly in ICANN
gTLD deliberations through the GAC  although GAC representatives are free to participate
directly in any ICANN constituency 
It is also essential that interested individuals and organizations monitor related policy initiatives
or consultations in their home countries  Some national governments may issue updates or
notices to their citizens and may also hold consultations on Internet policy matters  In these
cases  it is important that interested parties contribute to those discussions at a national level 
Input and comments to national governments help shape the positions that their
representatives will take in the GAC at ICANN  For more on the ways in which individuals and
organizations can participate in ICANN  http   www icann org en participate how-do-iparticipate

Shared Global Services and Operations
Focus Areas 
! Root Servers
! Country Code Top Level Domains (ccTLDs)
Root Servers
Background
The root zone file is at the apex of the Domain Name System (DNS) database  It contains
information only about the authoritative domain name servers for each top-level domain name  and
is used to ensure a request for information from any client for any top-level domain is directed to
the correct place  This database is used by almost all Internet applications as part of the process of
translating globally unique names like internetsociety org into other identifiers  the web  e-mail and
many other services make use of the DNS  That is to say  the DNS query for www example org
includes the full name  however  the response from the root server only points to the nameservers
for  org  In general terms  the root server operator does not typically log  share or analyze the type
of request except in aggregated form  or even have access to the original source address from
which the query is sent  While such data could be available under some circumstances  Industry
best practices for the protection of the security and integrity of the service dictate that it be
protected in accordance with data privacy laws 
The root zone file is housed in hundreds of computers known as root servers  located in many
countries in every region of the world  Root servers contain the IP addresses of all the TLD registry
name servers  including the gTLDs such as  com and the ccTLDs such as  de (Germany)  Root
servers  translate  names into next-level nameserver IP addresses  allowing the user’s software to
take the next step to finding desired Internet content  They perform a critical if somewhat  backoffice 
role in ensuring the continuity and therefore reliability of the Internet 
Players
IANA
IANA is the global coordinator of the DNS root  which is the uppermost part of the
DNS hierarchy  http   www iana org domains 
ICANN
In the context of root servers  ICANN is the responsible party for the operational
management of IANA under contract with the United States Department of
Commerce    ICANN is also the operator of the L Root 
Root Server Operators
The root server operator function is limited to making the data held in the root quickly  securely 
and reliably accessible to Internet users worldwide through the DNS protocol  Root server
operators and their organizations do not take part in editorial decisions about the content of the
DNS root zone  except to advise IANA on strictly technical matters such as management of
DNSSEC-related records  For a full list of the root server operators and locations 
http   www root-servers org 
RSSAC
The Root Server System Advisory Committee advises the ICANN Board and
community on the operation of the root name servers of the domain name system 
Its Executive Committee consists of representatives from each root name server  it
   http   www ntia doc gov ntiahome domainname iana ianacontract_       pdf
consults other DNS experts as well in forming its advice 
http   www icann org en groups rssac
In addition to their work in the RSSAC  the root server operators have maintained a
loose  informal association that predates ICANN for discussion of operational and
security matters relating to the service they provide  http   www root-servers org 
The Role of Root Servers and Root Server Operators
The root zone file is housed centrally and distributed periodically to each of the other root servers
around the world  At present  Verisign performs this function under a cooperative agreement with
the U S government (see below)  (Verisign also operates the A-root  but separately from this
function ) The root zone file is distributed to the root server operators using the same mechanisms
as any other DNS zone  and then further distributed by the operators using a methodology known
as anycast  Anycast  also widely used by DNS operators for important zones besides the root 
makes possible a more geographically distributed and resilient Internet  and provides for more
local access to the root servers around the world  (Anycast uses standard  well-tested features of
DNS and internet routing protocols to enable the use of many more operational DNS servers for
the root zone than the original     for example   f root-servers net   managed by Internet Systems
Consortium  provides service for the root zone from dozens of locations worldwide )
The root server operators are a group of independent and autonomous organizations that are
responsible for the management and maintenance of the root servers  Each operator is
responsible for the way in which its particular service is operated  This diversity is one of the
strengths of the system  Neither the IANA nor ICANN have any executive authority over the
operation of root name servers  By the same token  the root server operators have minimal
involvement in setting policy  They do not control what information is in the root zone or the
process of making changes to the root zone  They do play an important role  drawing on their
operational experience to share data  and to provide information and advice to one another and to
the IANA on operational matters and in policy setting  for example  during the deployment of
DNSSEC (Domain Name Security)  This is consistent with the root server operators’ strong
operational focus 
To fulfill their role within ICANN  which is set out in that organization’s Bylaws  the root server
operators participate in the Root Server System Advisory Committee (RSSAC)  The RSSAC is to
advise the ICANN community and Board on matters relating to the operation  administration 
security  and integrity of the Internet's root server system  The administrative work of the RSSAC is
carried out by its Executive Committee  while a Caucus of DNS and root server system experts are
responsible for the essential work of the RSSAC in providing that advice 
The Internet Architecture Board provides a liaison to the RSSAC  reflecting the fact that the IETF
has a key role in documenting the technical requirements of the DNS root servers together with the
root server operators themselves  ICANN and the various stakeholders  The ICANN Security and
Stability Advisory Committee (SSAC) also provide a liaison to RSSAC to promote discussion of
issues of mutual interest  The root server operators meet regularly at IETF and ICANN meetings 
They also participate in IETF processes  such as the DNSOP WG  which develops guidelines for
the operation of DNS software servers and the administration of DNS zones  and contribute to the
work on individual Internet drafts where their expertise can be useful 
Participation in Root Server Related Policy Activities
Anyone interested wishing to understand or participate in root server operators’ policy
development activities should explore the opportunities available with each of the root server
operators directly  because there are considerable differences among them  As a group  the root
server operators operate transparently and provide information to the public via their web site 
http   www root-servers org
In addition  some individual operators maintain their own web sites  usually under the letter naming
the root they operate 
http   $letter root-servers org  e g  http   k root-servers org or http   i root-servers org
For those who are not themselves directly involved in operating a root server  perhaps the most
appropriate avenue for interacting with the root server operators is through the ICANN process 
including the RSSAC  or through participation in the IETF 
Within ICANN  the RSSAC operates in accordance with ICANN community norms of openness 
and thus conduct open meetings and publish meeting minutes 
Within the IETF  the root server operators interact in accordance with IETF community norms 
including inviting open participation in the development of any Internet drafts or RFCs relevant to
the DNS root name service protocol or the operation and administration of DNS root servers 
Anycast and Increasing Capacity
The root server operators are involved at the operational level in many efforts to improve Internet
capacity throughout the world  Having one or more anycast instances of root servers nearby can
improve the speed  reliability  and security of internet service for users  so the root server
operators are generally willing to add anycast capacity wherever there is infrastructure to make it
possible to operate locally  Root server operators have collaborated with ISPs  Internet exchange
point (IXP) operators  RIRs  and some governments in order to bring improved DNS service for the
root as part of improving capacity overall 
Formal Policy and Documentation
Historically  because of their operational focus and the fact that their role predates ICANN and
most formal Internet governance debates  the root server operators have not been major
participants in formal policy processes  In addition to the informal mechanisms discussed above 
however  there are a few documents regarding root server operations that have served to describe
relevant relationships

Country Code Top Level Domains (ccTLDs)
Background
A country code top-level domain (ccTLD) is an Internet top-level domain generally used by
a country – for example   de (Germany)   ke (Kenya) and  jp (Japan) – and designated
according to the ISO two-letter country code standard   
ICANN’s introduction of a fast track for internationalized ccTLDs has proven successful and
popular  while work continues to resolve a range of technical issues   
The Players
IANA

ccNSO
The Country Code Names Supporting Organization (ccNSO) is the policy
development body created for and by ccTLD managers for ccTLD issues within
ICANN  http   ccnso icann org

ccTLD operators
See the list from the IANA website  http   www iana org domains root db 
Regional ccTLD associations
There are a number of regional ccTLD organizations 
AFTLD for Africa http   www aptld org
APTLD for Asia Pacific http   www aptld org
CENTR for Europe http   www centr org
LACTLD for Latin America and the Caribbean http   www lactld org
Structure of ccTLD Policy Processes
Policies are set by the trustee operator (formally called  the manager ) for the day-to-day
management of a particular country’s ccTLD and by the ccTLD community  the regional ccTLD
associations and the ccNSO within ICANN  for policies relevant to the operation of ccTLDs
overall 
Requests for the delegation or redelegation of a ccTLD  as with all TLDs  are handled by the
IANA function  Basic principles govern the delegation or redelegation of a ccTLD  for example 
it is required that the manager be a responsible and technically competent trustee of the
domain on behalf of the national and global Internet communities  In many cases a
government agency acts as a trustee for the delegation of the ccTLD and may also act as the
operator of the ccTLD 
When a delegation or redelegation of a ccTLD is requested  the U S  Department of
Commerce  as the Root Zone Administrator  is responsible for verifying that processing
procedures have been followed  and authorising any related changes to the DNS root zone
and root zone database 
Policy that relates to the overall operation of the ccTLDs is set by the ccTLDs through ICANN 
Any policy proposal would likely start when a proposal is brought forward to the ccNSO by an
individual ccNSO member (a ccTLD operator) or by one of the regional ccTLD associations
(CENTR for Europe  for example) 
The policy development process of the ccNSO is described fully in the ICANN Bylaws 
http   www icann org en about governance bylaws#AnnexB
Policy changes can also be proposed by the GAC - the government advisory body to ICANN 
Indeed the ccNSO and the GAC often cooperate within ICANN to propose policy changes  For
example  the ccNSO and the GAC collaborated to develop policy proposals for the introduction
of IDN (internationalized domain name) ccTLDs 
Proposals that will affect the operation of ccTLDs globally are presented to the ICANN Board
for review and approval  The recent introduction of  fast-track  Internationalized ccTLDs is a
useful example of the ccNSO’s policy development process and can be found here 
http   ccnso icann org policy cctld-idn
For more information on the IDN ccTLDs fast track  http   www icann org en topics idn fast-track 
How to Participate in ccTLD Policy Processes
As an interested individual or organization participation is possible through a number of routes 
Some ccTLD operators have their own open policy development processes  and it is possible
to participate in those processes online or through open meetings  For example  Nominet  the
ccTLD operator for  uk  encourages engagement in its policy development processes 
http   nominet com policy process 
ICANN also has open consultations  To be more involved in ICANN interested individuals can
participate in  for example  the ALAC (At-Large Community) that represents the interests of
individual Internet users 
As a government representative or as an affiliated entity (registry  associated business  etc ) it
is best to contact the appropriate ccTLD first to better understand how to engage in related
national policy development  With some ccTLD operators it is possible to contribute to policy
development without being a member  registrar or other associated entity  Mechanisms for
participation will differ from ccTLD operator to ccTLD operator

Open Standards Development
Focus Area 
! Internet Society affiliated organizations and other Internet standards bodies
Background
The Internet is built on technical standards that allow devices  services  and applications to be
interoperable across a wide and dispersed network of networks  By focusing on interoperability
for passing traffic between networks  Internet standards describe the protocols without
prescribing device characteristics  business models  or content 
The Internet depends on several types of technical standards  developed by a range of
organizations  These include  among others  standards and protocols developed by the
Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF)  as well as telecommunications infrastructure
standards developed by the International Telecommunications Union (ITU)  hardware
standards developed by bodies such as the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers
(IEEE)  and application and software standards  such as those developed by the World Wide
Web Consortium (W C)  A key principle for effective standards development is respectful
cooperation between standards organizations  with each respecting the autonomy  integrity 
processes  and intellectual property rules of the others  The leading Internet standards
organizations have jointly agreed on the essence of the modern paradigm for standards  and
encourage others to adopt and support these proven principles through the OpenStand
movement

Structure of Internet Standards Development
The following offers a brief and necessarily broad-brush outline of the standardization
processes structures of the IETF  the W C and the IEEE-SA  These organizations work to
ensure that the standards they develop contribute to and further the stability and continuity of
the Internet  However  these organizations have differing approaches and processes and
differing membership structures – or none at all in the case of the IETF 
These organizations have responsibility for different  but complementary  areas of
standardization  For example  the IETF does not standardize transmission hardware – that is
the responsibility of organizations like the IEEE  Nor does it standardize specialized World
Wide Web specifications such as HTML and XML  which are the responsibility of the W C 
The IETF does standardize all the protocol layers in between  from IP itself up to general
applications like email and HTTP 
Whether infrastructure  hardware or software standards  each plays an important role in
contributing to the Internet’s success and increasing ubiquity  Ensuring that relevant standards
organizations cooperate and actively work together to maximize effectiveness  and thereby
avoid duplication  market confusion and resource inefficiencies  is essential in this increasingly
converged Internet  computing and telecommunications world 
IETF
The Internet Engineering Task Force is a self-organized group of experts who
contribute to the engineering and evolution of Internet technologies  It is the
principal body engaged in the evolution of existing Internet standards and the
development of new Internet standard specifications  The IETF is unusual in that it
exists as a collection of gatherings  but is not as a corporation  It has no board of
directors  no members  and no dues   
The IETF’s mission includes the following  among others  identifying  and proposing
solutions to pressing operational and technical problems in the Internet  specifying
the development or usage of protocols and the near-term architecture to solve such
technical problems for the Internet  making recommendations regarding the
standardization of protocols and protocol usage in the Internet  providing a forum for
the exchange of information within the Internet community between vendors  users 
researchers  agency contractors  and network managers  The IETF meets   times
a year in locations around the world    These face-to-face meetings are
opportunities for engineers to share knowledge and expertise – whether long time
participants  or newcomers 
For an in-depth introduction to the IETF  please see  http   www ietf org tao html
The Internet Standards developed by the open processes of the IETF and related
organizations are published in the Request For Comments (RFC) document series 
http   en wikipedia org wiki Request_for_Comments
Every IETF standard is published as an RFC (a  Request for Comments)  and
every RFC starts out as an Internet Draft (often called an  I-D )  An Internet
Draft is the working document of the IETF  its work areas    and its Working
Groups  Once the Internet Draft has received comments and is considered to
have achieved sufficient agreement it is given to a work Area Director for
presentation to the IESG  Further review of the Internet Draft by the wider
IETF is also recommended

from the IETF community prior to further consideration by the IESG and
possible approval  Once the Internet Draft is approved it is published as a
Proposed Standard by the RFC Editor 
An important aspect of the IETF’s process is that decisions are taken on a  rough
consensus  basis  meaning that a very large majority of those who care about
whether an Internet Draft is approved must agree and all issues have been
discussed and addressed  This consensus does not require that all participants
agree although this is  of course  preferred  In general  the dominant view of the
working group prevails   
The full standards development process can be found here 
http   tools ietf org html rfc      
The IETF is focused in its activities and does not develop new activities when
expertise is better represented elsewhere  The IETF is chiefly scoped to work on
 protocols and practices for which secure and scalable implementations are
expected to have wide deployment and interoperation on the Internet  or to form
part of the infrastructure of the Internet   Adhering to this scope also allows the IETF
to work in partnership with other standards organizations  where appropriate  on
items of mutual interest  http   www ietf org liaison managers html
W C
The World Wide Web Consortium (W C) is an international consortium that
develops Web standards and guidelines designed to ensure long-term growth for
the Web  W C is administered via a joint agreement among its host institutions  MIT
in the USA  the European Research Consortium in Informatics and Mathematics
(ERCIM) in France  Keio University in Japan  and Beihang University in China 
Sir Tim Berners-Lee  W C Director and author of WWW and HTML  established the
W C in      to ensure compatibility and agreement among industry members in
the adoption of new WWW standards    The W C’s mission is to lead the World
Wide Web to its full potential by developing protocols and guidelines that ensure the
long-term growth of the Web   
   http   tools ietf org html rfc    
   Portions of RFC     have been updated in subsequent RFCs  Please see http   www rfc-editor org info rfc    
   The Internet is a vast network of networks  interconnected in many different physical ways  yet all speaking a common
language  specified by standardized protocols  The Web is one – albeit  the most influential and well known – of many
different applications which run over the Internet 
   http   www w  org Consortium mission#vision
Membership is open to all types of organizations (including commercial  educational
and governmental entities) and individuals    Individual Web developers and other
interested stakeholders are also invited to participate in W C Working Groups and
Community Groups without taking out formal membership 
At the W C  standardization work items start as a Working Draft (not dissimilar to
the Internet Draft at the IETF) which is subject to W C and broader review 
proceeds through a set of stages based largely on the maturity of the work in
question  including candidate recommendation  proposed recommendation and
finally W C Recommendation (a standard reviewed and endorsed by W C
members and the Director)

IEEE-SA
The Institute for Electrical and Electronics Engineering (IEEE) undertakes its
standardization work through the IEEE Standards Association (IEEE-SA)  In
addition to producing the     Standards for Local and Metropolitan Area Networks
and wireless networks such as WiFi  IEEE-SA also develops the standards for 
! Intelligent highway systems and vehicular technology
! Distributed generation renewable energy
! Voting Equipment Electronic Data Interchange
! Rechargeable Batteries for PCs
! Components Architecture for Encrypted Shared Media Organic Field Effect
Technology  and many others  
The IEEE-SA has many thousands of members from businesses  universities and
governments as well as members who participate in an individual capacity    There
are three levels of membership  individual  as well as basic and advanced corporate
membership

How to Participate in Internet-Related Standards Development
IETF
The IETF is an open organization  There is no formal membership  no membership
fee  and nothing to sign  By participating (joining a mailing list discussion or a
meeting)  one agrees automatically to accept the IETF's rules  including rules about
intellectual property (patents  copyrights and trademarks)   
There are a number of ways of participating in the IETF depending on one’s level of
interest  Because much of the detailed technical work is done online  primarily via
email  joining the mailing lists for one or two Working Groups is a good way to get a
feel for the work and processes  Proposals are made and discussed  issues are
raised and  ultimately  consensus is established online 
Another way to participate is to attend an IETF meeting  This allows for a more
immediate feel for the IETF and also provides for an opportunity to participate in
some introductory sessions  Following issues of interest through the mailing lists
can be hugely beneficial prior to going to an IETF meeting

The Internet Society also offers fellowships to the IETF as a part of its Next
Generation Leadership program  http   www isoc org educpillar fellowship index php
The Internet Society also recognizes that  although they are very technical  IETF
working group discussions define the future of Internet-based communications
protocols  At the same time  policy influences how these technical solutions are
implemented and used by society at large  To encourage government policy makers
to understand the importance of these linkages  the Internet Society has established
the IETF Policy Program  Invited policy makers from both developing and
developed countries are encouraged to interact closely with IETF participants in an
environment that supports dialogue  information sharing  and problem solving  The
goal is to build support among policy makers worldwide for the IETF’s unique model
of standards development and to provide an opportunity for the IETF to gain a
better understanding of Internet related policy concerns and priorities in developing
countries 
The topics addressed in the program include  technical aspects of the Domain
Name System  an overview of IP routing  interconnection and traffic exchange 
security and privacy protocols  and the open standards processes  The program
also creates an alumni network of past participants to keep in touch and provides a
networking platform

W C
Participation in the W C standardization processes occurs largely through its
membership  but there are opportunities for non-members and the public at large to
participate  as well as opportunities for individual experts 
The  W C invites the public to participate in W C via discussion lists  events  blogs 
translations  and other means described below  Participation in Community and
Business Groups is open to all  Participation inW C Working Groups (and other
types) is open to W C Members and other invited parties  W C groups work with
the public through specification reviews as well as contributions of use cases  tests 
and implementation feedback

OpenStand Principles for Open Standards Development
In       five leading global Internet standards organizations announced their agreement on
jointly developed principles establishing a modern paradigm for standards  The shared
OpenStand principles grew from their collective experience of standardization processes that
have made the Internet and the World Wide Web today’s premiere platforms for innovation
and borderless commerce  The effectiveness and efficiency of these principles and the
modern paradigm for standards are proven by their ability to foster competition and
cooperation  support innovation and interoperability and drive market success 
The OpenStand principles encapsulate that successful standardization model and make it
extendable across the contemporary  global economy’s gamut of technologies and markets 
The principles comprise a modern paradigm in which the economics of global markets—fueled
by technological innovation—drive global deployment of standards  regardless of their formal
status within traditional bodies of national representation 
The OpenStand principles demand 
   Cooperation
Respectful cooperation between standards organizations  whereby each respects the
autonomy  integrity  processes  and intellectual property rules of the others 
   Adherence to Principles
Adherence to the five fundamental principles of standards development 
! Due Process  Decisions are made with equity and fairness among participants 
No one party dominates or guides standards development  Standards
processes are transparent and opportunities exist to appeal decisions 
Processes for periodic standards review and updating are well defined 
! Broad Consensus  Processes allow for all views to be considered and
addressed  such that agreement can be found across a range of interests 
! Transparency  Standards organizations provide advance public notice of
proposed standards development activities  the scope of work to be undertaken 
and conditions for participation  Easily accessible records of decisions and the
materials used in reaching those decisions are provided  Public comment
periods are provided before final standards approval and adoption 
! Balance  Standards activities are not exclusively dominated by any particular
person  company or interest group 
! Openness  Standards processes are open to all interested and informed
parties 
   Collective Empowerment
Commitment by affirming standards organizations and their participants to collective
empowerment by striving for standards that 
! are chosen and defined based on technical merit  as judged by the contributed
expertise of each participant 
! provide global interoperability  scalability  stability  and resiliency 
! enable global competition 
! serve as building blocks for further innovation  and
! contribute to the creation of global communities  benefiting humanity 
   Availability
Standards specifications are made accessible to all for implementation and
deployment  Affirming standards organizations have defined procedures to develop
specifications that can be implemented under fair terms  Given market diversity  fair
terms may vary from royalty-free to fair  reasonable  and non-discriminatory terms
(FRAND) 
   Voluntary Adoption
Standards are voluntarily adopted and success is determined by the market  Since the
statement was announced  hundreds of organizations  individuals and firms have
formally endorsed or expressed their support for the OpenStand principles 
http   open-stand org 

Section    Internet Governance PrinciplesThere are a number of principles which are considered to be important for Internet governance   From those principles  we would like to submit the following principles which we believe are especially important The first is pragmatism   As expressed by the widely quoted phrase in the Internet Technical Community  We believe in rough consensus and running code  which is described in Tao of IETF  internet technical standards are developed by requiring standards which actually are able to operate  accepting the existence of multiple standards  as well as by leaving the choice and its deployment to users of such standards  This has successfully suppressed unrealistic specifications to be standardized  and is achieving development of pragmatic standards   For stakeholders affected by policies  it is important not only in technical spheres but also in policy spheres that policies to be developed are pragmatic The second is well-informed decision based on evidence   In either technical or political spheres  the issues of the Internet Governance are specialized in many cases and often require highly expertized knowledge in making judgment   Therefore  it is important that people with high expertise make considerations based on various evidences   In addition  in cases where people without expertise are involved in making a judgment  they should make judgments based on the experts’ consideration with evidence The last is verifiability of policy deliberation process  In the tradition of the Internet  anyone can verify discussions and decisions made in policy or standard development process   as materials  proposals and discussion to develop policies or standards are recorded and are made publicly available  This accommodates dynamic and timely discussions to adjust to rapid changes in technological advancement and markets  while at the same time  enables to make modifications as needed by later reviewing the discussions  including the adequacy of the discussions process   This is important for further evolution of the policy process for the Internet for the future Section    Roadmap for the Further Evolution of the Internet Governance Ecosystem

The Internet Governance as a whole covers a wide range of issues  ranging from technical developments to public policies  In developing standards and policies for these issues  there are various entities responsible for a particular area of the issues  and they are engaged in working on issues which are under their responsibilities  based on their expertise While the existing entities have been handling issues in their respective areas successfully until today  it is possible to have a complex set of issues or new issues to arise as the Internet becomes increasingly sophisticated To deal with such issues effectively  and to maximize the expertize which has been built by each entity until today  there may be a need to have a new function catalyzing among each of the entities  to coordinate collaborative efforts and enable a coordinated set to multiple activities  which address complex and emerging issues   We believe it is important for each entity to pursue further efforts in its respective areas of responsibilities  and through clarifications of role of each entity  respect and make good use of expertise of other entities   In order to find new approach of addressing emerging issues which cannot be fully covered by each entity’s expertise  the catalyst function will be needed  as well as  enhancement of high-level cooperation among these entities

and
for
the
future 
We
believe
that
there
is
no
need
to
revise
this
definition 
 We support the existing definition of Internet Governance 
  The
subject
of
Internet
Governance
is
the
Internet
as

have
been
critical
to

 The subject of Internet Governance discussions is the Internet as we know it and its core
values 
  Among
these
features
is
the
 multistakeholder
model 
of

cooperation 
which
was
also
identified
during
the
World
Summit
on
the
Information

been
in
operation
since
the
earliest
days
of

In
referring

stress
the
importance
of
a
sustainable
and
effective
bridge
between

  An

which
examined
 ICANN’s

in
the

has
also
produced
a
valuable

which
articulated
  
Rs 
–
the
principles
of
Reciprocity

Reality
–
which
have
been
applied
in

such
as
those
facilitated
by
the

Task
Force
(IETF) 
and
others 
We
support
this
formulation 
but
also
agree
with
the
Panel
that
we
do
not
seek
a
 single
constitutional
moment 
for

 There

  Importantly 
as
identified

process 
Internet
Governance
must
be
advanced
through
suitable
processes
that
respect

enhance
the

already
exist
for
certain

issues
in
various
communities

non-­-decision-­-making
global
forum
in
which
Internet

of
the
global
Internet
Governance
environment 
even
while
it
matures
to
better
meet

 The Internet Governance Forum should remain a central element of the global Internet

  The
NETmundial
is
understood
to
be
a
one-­-time

Section    Roadmap for the Further Evolution of the Internet Governance Ecosystem
We make the following recommendations for the future of Internet Governance  Our
recommendations are not exhaustive  but are essential to successful Internet Governance in the
future 
First  on the question of ICANN and the associated IANA activities we would assert that
governance of these functions must be undertaken consistently with accepted principles of
Internet Governance  as outlined in the      Montevideo Statement   That statement called for
accelerating the globalization of ICANN and the IANA functions towards an environment where
all stakeholders  including all governments  participate on an equal footing  Aside from these
broad principles  the details of any transition and any new arrangements should not be a primary
focus for NETmundial 
Secondly 
we
would
like
to
make
the
following
recommendations
on
the
Internet
Governance
Forum
(IGF) 
   Internet
Governance
will
remain
important
to
the
global
community
for
as
long
as
the
Internet
continues
to
grow
and
evolve 
Therefore
we
propose
a
renewal
of
current
IGF
arrangements
for
a
further
  
years
after
the
current
 -­-year
cycle 
A
longer-­-term
renewal
of
the
IGF
mandate
should
not
preclude
an
evolutionary
transition
of
the
IGF
to
a
more
sustainable
model 
This
will
promote
a
clearer
understanding
of
its
importance 
legitimacy
and
longevity 
   The
IGF
must
continue
as
a
 non-­-binding 
forum 
and
produce
useful
outputs 
through
appropriate
participatory
and
consensus-­-based
decision-­-making
processes 
These
may
take
the
form
of
reports
from
IGF
meetings
and
processes 
informational
papers
resulting
from
emerging
working
groups 
and
non-­-binding
recommendations
based
on
case
studies
and
emergent
best
practices 
   The
IGF
needs
to
evolve
and
be
strengthened 
Some
evolutionary
changes
may
gain
impetus
from
external
processes 
such
as
NETmundial 
They
must
be
subject
to
review
through
the
IGF
process
itself
to
ensure
that
multistakeholder
legitimacy
is
continually
maintained
and
enhanced 
   The
IGF’s
Multistakeholder
Advisory
Group
(MAG) 
has
played
an
important
role
in
the
IGF 
It
is
essential
that
the
MAG
receive
strong
support
from
the
IGF
Secretariat 
Some
MAG
processes
could
also
improve 
including
transparency
and
predictability
of
selection
of
members

http   www intgovforum org cms magabout
   Further
improvement
of
the
IGF
requires
a
strong 
stable
Secretariat 
with
the
human
and
financial
resources
to
effectively
meet
a
range
of
administrative
tasks 
including
IGF
site
selection 
negotiation
with
hosts 
design
of
the
event 
funding
and
fundraising 
reporting 
planning
and
resourcing 
   The
IGF
has
benefited
greatly
from
intersessional
activities 
including
national
and
regional
IGF
events  
These
IGF-­-related
events
have
proven
to
very
beneficial
in
increasing
the
reach
and
impact
of
the
overall
IGF
process 
There
is
a
need
for
ongoing
support
to
inter-­-link
them
with
an
overall
IGF
process
in
a
way
that
increases
their
value
for
all
participants 
   In
addition
and
complimentary
to
these
IGF
events 
ongoing
multi-­-stakeholder
discussions
are
occurring
online
in
a
number
of
forums 
These
discussions
have
tended
to
be
specific
to
stakeholder
communities
rather
than
encompassing
all
stakeholders 
We
recommend
that
   net 
be
recognized
as
one
encompassing
multistakeholder
forum
for
holding
intersessional
IGF
related
discussions
in
an
open
and
constructive
manner
and
for
building
consensus
to
be
channeled
through
IGF

* The interconnection of Networks and Internet traffic exchange among network operators should be encouraged  promoted and agreed between the interested parties  Regulations should be minimised or avoided in order to promote interconnections and intervention is only advisable when there are barriers fo such interconnections  

 

* The groups and Internet governance bodies to be created should include appropriate representation from network operator groups 

Internet Exchange Points

 

An Internet Exchange Points (IXP) are considered critical infrastructure for the Internet and are a fundamental component for its Sustainability  Resilience and growth  IXPs are neutral network facilities that enables the interconnection of more than two independent Internet networks  for the purpose of facilitating interconnections 

 

An IXP does not require the Internet traffic passing between any pair of participating Autonomous Systems to pass through any third Autonomous System  nor does it alter or otherwise interfere with such traffic  The rules and conditions for traffic exchange are agreed by its members 

 

The LAC-IX Association

 

The association of Internet Exchange Points for Latin America and Caribbean (LAC-IX) was formally constituted in      to increase the collaboration between traffic exchange points in the LAC region  It's been growing and supporting the establishment of additional IXPs since then  

 

Contribution to Internet Principles 

 

Some IXPs in the LAC region have already developed Internet Principles which are public  Among them  there are principles affecting traffic exchange  

 

* The interconnection between various Internet actors  with non-discriminatory conditions that enable guaranteed access to the network and it’s contents in all the national territory  must be promoted 

 

* The stability of the network  it’s security and global functionality must be actively preserved by means of adopting technical measures that are compatible with international standards  and encouraging the adoption of best practices  No one should have the ability to  turn off  the Internet totally or partially  in a territory and or a specific segment of the population  and the service providers must be able to provide their services freely 

 

* The architecture of the Internet and the communications systems  must be based on open standards that enable interoperability 

 

* The juridical and regulatory environments must preserve the dynamics of the Internet  as an open collaborative space for all users  and must be guaranteed to remain free of blocks  interruptions  censures  interferences and surveillance 

 

* Internet governance must promote the continuous development and widespread dissemination of new technologies and models for access and use  

 

* All action taken against illicit activity on the network must be aimed at those directly responsible for such activities  and not at the means of access and transport 

FROM FORUM TO WORLD INTERNET GOVERNANCE ORGANISATION

 

The contention concerning who governs the internet or how it should be governed has been the major focus of the top ICT organizations  The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) is one of these bodies alongside ITU  US Department of Commerce  Internet Society (ISOC) etc  where technically  the US Government has been in charge of the Internet  which is no longer acceptable by some countries of the world  the internet has grown past the control of one country 

 

The issues of big data  security  surveillance and sovereignty have raised concerns among nations on how and what internet governance should be 

 

The Internet now has become the  storehouse    access route  for numerous entities including government  civil society  technical bodies that are keen about the affordability  accessibility  openness and privacy  and above all  security of the online citizens  This means that all entities duly categorized by countries have now become citizens of this NET-NATION 

 

Therefore  in order for the Internet to escape sole control by a single government  all other countries must be equally involved in such control  First of all  addressing the issue of Cybercrime and security of the Internet  is one thing that interests everybody and every nation  I believe when nations commit to finding  lasting solutions for this singular challenge of cybercrime and cyber security  the other challenges of the Internet Governance like the technical  legal and regulatory  policy making and the rest can easily be resolved with equal multistakeholder privilege 

 

For the future of the Internet to be secured  all actors in their respective roles must have a common properly structured platform   WORLD INTERNET GOVERNANCE ORGANISATION (WIGO)  a global organization with equal participation of the Government  Private sector  Civil Society  Technical Community in a multi-stakeholder consensus building  NET-NATIONS 

 

Governments (globally) have to play a role in the decision-making in governing the Internet   Government should equally see the  NET  as an avenue with great advantage since a lot of benefits can be favorable to all if collectively agreed upon  Nations would be members of WIGO  replicating same at the country level 

 

It is necessary to emphasis here that the Internet ecosystem should maintain the multistakeholder approach  which has so far worked  in the ‘Future of Internet Governance’  The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) has so far provided a stage for multi-stakeholderism approach for governing the internet  save for the legal instrument establishing it  The future Internet Governance should therefore adopt same approach in the new organization 

 

I propose that ICANN be changed to WIGO with all its functions  this will reduce the learning curve period of the new organisation  and nations would have equal say in the Future Internet Governance   

 

Since internet governance is a new phenomenon  education of the Net Citizens on its real meaning is a task that must be accomplished by WIGO

The Information Technology Industry Council (ITI) respectfully submits this paper for consideration by participants of the  Global Multistakeholder Meeting on the Future of Internet Governance  or NETmundial  and other interested parties  We applaud the Brazilian Government for taking this initiative to bring together stakeholders from around the world to discuss the important subject of Internet governance  ITI is the premier advocacy and policy organization for the world’s leading innovation companies   Our members pioneer cutting-edge products and services that improve people’s daily lives  and maintain investments  supply chains and operations around the world   As a result  we have an acute understanding of the impact of international policies can have on the Internet and the World Wide Web  By any measure  the Internet has been a global phenomenon  spurring growth in communications  access to information and economic opportunity unprecedented in the annals of recent human history   Much of credit for this dynamism can be attributed to the careful stewardship of a decentralized array of private sector  caretakers  such as the Internet Society (ISOC)  the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF)  and the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) 

 

 These multistakeholder institutions in which anyone can participate have played an important role in building the Internet into the vibrant platform that it is today  Under the current governance model  the Internet and the World Wide Web have generated an unprecedented explosion in commerce and creativity   According to a      study by the McKinsey Global Institute  nearly eight trillion dollars of business occurs each year through e-commerce [i]  What many may not realize  however  is that both developed and developing countries are benefiting   A      report by the World Bank concluded that the growth broadband provides for developing countries was of similar magnitude as that for developed economies – about a      percent increase in GDP for each    percent increase in Internet penetration [ii] As stakeholders  we all must insist that any alternative approach to Internet governance be subject to a careful and thorough cost-benefit and public interest analysis that fully considers potential impacts on e-commerce  education  the ability to improve healthcare and accessibility of government services  as well as the unrestricted flow of information and ideas   This is of particular importance to the myriad developing countries that have been making significant investments in people and infrastructure to empower their people to tap the stream of economic and social benefits that flow from the Internet   Key Principles of Governance The Internet is transforming the world   Even so  it is important to bear in mind that  as a technology and platform  the Internet is still in its infancy   It continues to evolve and move in directions unanticipated by even the most experienced technologists   Growth and stability are not automatic  and it is not a task that can be assumed by a single entity   We recommend adherence to the following key principles of governance to help ensure the future vibrancy and resilience of the Internet 

 

 

           Any governance model must promote the following 

    Expanding access to broadband networks so that these benefits can reach all of the world’s citizens   The world deserves the access to knowledge  services  commerce  and communication  the accompanying benefits to economic development  education  and health care  and the informed discussion that the Internet provides 

 

    Continuing the free flow of information   The Internet’s importance as a platform for commerce  for education  for information and knowledge sharing  for self-expression  and for organization and assembly  depends on the global free flow of information 

 

    Allowing for the ability to innovate  to develop technical capacity  and to create and take advantage of economic opportunities   This can be achieved by promoting the current  distributed  interoperable  and interconnected nature of the Internet 

 

    Assuring the continuing security  stability  and resiliency of the Internet 

 

    Ensuring that individuals can exercise their human rights  both online and offline 

 

    Recognition of government limitations on the collection of information on Internet users based on users’ reasonable privacy interests and the impact on trust in the Internet 

 

       Any governance model should include the following characteristics 

 

    All stakeholders – individual users  governments  civil society  businesses  and members of the academic and technical community – have a stake in preserving the Internet as a critical platform for communication and information exchange   Therefore  all stakeholders should be appropriately included in governance decisions   All of these stakeholders have contributed to the development of the Internet to date and  working together  have driven unprecedented growth in access to  uses of  and innovation on the Internet   They must continue to be involved in any future model of Internet governance 

 

    Any policy-making associated with the Internet must promote access  transparency and accountability  and must be grounded in respect for the rule of law 

 

Conclusion The phenomenal success of the Internet is due in no small part to the multistakeholder governance model that guides technology and policy decisions   A variety of organizations that include participation from businesses  civil society organizations  government representatives and technical experts have followed this de facto blueprint to manage the exponential growth of the Internet throughout the world  creating a flexible infrastructure that has successfully absorbed new technologies and demands in a seamless and cost-effective manner   This multistakeholder collaboration has produced a stable  predictable environment that has helped facilitate continuing innovation and attract investments that have spread economic benefits around the globe  benefitting developed and developing economies alike   We believe that the existing system of governance for the Internet is effective and inclusive  and for this reason  it should continue to be improved and reinforced  We welcome inquiries and feedback from all stakeholders regarding our views  and look forward to hearing and considering the views of other stakeholders on this important topic  Thank your for your consideration 

The Internet Governance Working Group of the Information Technology Industry Council (ITI) respectfully submits this paper regarding our recommendations for a Roadmap for Further Evolution of the Internet Governance Ecosystem for consideration at the  Global Multistakeholder Meeting on the Future of Internet Governance  or NETmundial parties  We applaud the Brazilian Government for taking this initiative to bring together stakeholders from around the world to discuss the important subject of Internet governance  ITI is the premier advocacy and policy organization for the world’s leading innovation companies 

 

Our members pioneer cutting-edge products and services that improve people’s daily lives  and maintain investments  supply chains and operations around the world   As a result  we have an acute understanding of the impact of international policies can have on the Internet and the World Wide Web  In recent years  some governments have argued that a multilateral  rather than a multistakeholder  model for Internet governance would better serve public policy objectives   The multistakeholder model approach to Internet governance and technical management has allowed the Internet to grow and flourish into the critical global platform it is today  and we believe it will continue to best serve Internet users far into the future  As we see it  there are two main challenges before us   First  we must ensure the Internet governance model continues to evolve in a manner that allows all stakeholders to have a voice in critical policy discussions 

 

The Internet is expected to serve   -  % of the world’s population by        Uses of the Internet continue to grow and diversify   Second  all actors have a common interest in the security  stability and interoperability of the overall infrastructure   However  no one actor or organization has the capacity to address all of the various public policy and technical issues impacting the Internet and its users  Because Internet governance is multifaceted – spanning technical  political  and policy issues – there is no single organization that manages or has jurisdiction over all Internet governance questions  instead  the Internet’s policies and protocols have rapidly evolved through a set of diverse organizations   Together  the robust set of multistakeholder Internet institutions – ICANN  IETF  ISOC  etc  – each with different core functions and strengths  address nearly all Internet policy and technical issues   Nevertheless  there is still room for improvement  and the ICT industry welcomes the opportunity to work with all stakeholders to help create an even more robust  flexible and stable Internet 

 

Areas for Improvement

 

The Internet community does not lack for places to discuss key Internet policy and governance questions   Rather  a critical concern voiced by some stakeholders is that the assortment of organizations and overlapping missions is confusing and difficult to navigate without considerable time and effort   While these concerns are valid  they should not necessarily lead to the conclusion that all Internet policy discussions must take place in one body   Rather  we must find a way to take advantage of the richness of the ecosystem while making it easier to navigate  especially for new entrants  It is incumbent on participants within the current governance model to bring new stakeholders whose voices may not be effectively heard into the conversation 

 

Increased outreach  capacity building and training for regulators 

 

While many if not all of the technical meetings are inclusive of all participants  the majority of the meetings historically have taken place in the developed world and their processes can be difficult to grasp as a newcomer   We applaud recent efforts undertaken by the IETF and ISOC to increase the global reach of their meetings as well as offer fellowships to engineers and policymakers from the developing world   We would support similar efforts in this space in other fora as these present important opportunities to engage thought leaders globally  Increase outreach to and participation of newcomers   International organizations should make it easier for newer participants to meaningfully engage in their processes   To do this  these organizations should offer training and newcomer sessions both at their physical meetings and remotely as a means of introducing more people to the organizations and encouraging them to participate in critical Internet governance discussions 

 

Improve transparency and accountability 

 

Multilateral organizations whose missions touch the Internet (e g   UNESCO  OECD  UN  and ITU) should provide better transparency and accountability in their decision-making processes  and how the overall decisions impact the Internet  and appropriately include other stakeholders in those decision making processes   All Internet governance institutions should strive to make relevant governance and policy documents available to all stakeholders at no cost   Participation in board and governance meetings of Internet governance organizations should be open whenever possible   For many participants  it is difficult and often cost-prohibitive to attend meetings in person   For that reason  Internet governance institutions should strive to improve remote participation opportunities 

 

Other Potential Risks to the Future of the Internet

 

We would be remiss if did not also address other factors that could have a negative impact on the future of the Internet and on any nation’s ability to leverage the Internet in order to reap the benefits of the digital economy  These include national policy initiatives that could restrict information flows and require that only in-country data servers be used to process and store the bits and bytes that fuel the digital economy   We believe that such  solutions  could actually impede a country’s ability to strengthen uphold privacy protections and security  while also creating significant obstacles to expanding online commerce and digital trade  Data localization mandates could leave nations even more vulnerable to security risks   Data security is not a question of server location  but rather depends upon the mechanisms and controls in place to safeguard the data   These mandates would essentially cut off businesses and consumers from the world’s most cutting edge technology and technology solutions   It would also restrict the ability of local technology companies  technical experts and researchers to partner with entities in other countries  and thereby limit their ability to leverage the Internet to expand job opportunities and business start-ups 

 

It could also harm the ability to grow its domestic technology dependent industries  such as ICT services  banking  and manufacturing   Ultimately  the adoption of such policies could embolden other countries to implement reciprocal policies  leading to a fragmented Internet with country after country walling off their digital ecosystems  Data security and privacy issues are very real and urgent  we share these concerns   However  risks to global commerce and the free flow of information are also very real and urgent   Commerce and security and privacy do not have to be mutually exclusive   With balanced and thoughtful policies  developed via increased bilateral  multilateral  and multistakeholder cooperation  nations can achieve both  and create a digital ecosystem that enables their businesses and citizens to thrive and grow in our interconnected global economy   ITI would welcome the opportunity to work with governments and other stakeholders to address these important goals 

 

Conclusion

 

The phenomenal success of the Internet is due in no small part to the multistakeholder governance model that guides technology and policy decisions   A variety of organizations that include participation from businesses  civil society organizations  government representatives and technical experts have followed this de facto blueprint to manage the exponential growth of the Internet throughout the world  creating a flexible infrastructure that has successfully absorbed new technologies and demands in a seamless and cost-effective manner   This multistakeholder collaboration has produced a stable  predictable environment that has helped facilitate continuing innovation and attract investments that have spread economic benefits around the globe  benefitting developed and developing economies alike   We believe that the existing system of governance for the Internet is effective and inclusive  and for this reason  it should continue to be improved and reinforced  We welcome inquiries and feedback from all stakeholders regarding our views  and look forward to hearing and considering the views of other stakeholders on this important topic 

The current challenges the Internet is facing
There is no doubt that Internet has revolutionized without precedent several aspects of human life  since becoming a facilitator of daily basis activities up to enabling the exercise of basic human and civil rights  Notwithstanding  Internet is currently facing several challenges that constitute a permanent treat and that harness its further development  Among these  we can find the several 
Internationalization of ICANN and IANA functions  This non-lucrative  non-governmental organization for the coordination and supervision of technical parameters of Internet through a multistakeholder participation model  is currently facing the challenge of positioning itself as a real multicultural organization  lessening its linkage to California law and deepening the globalization of the IANA functions it currently performs under contract with the US Government (Department of Commerce   NTIA)  Even though several efforts have been made  as the opening of several contact offices throughout in Beijing  Brasilia and Montevideo  the cultural diversification of its employees  summed up to the very symbolic coronation of these efforts by choosing a Lebanese CEO  and the linguistic diversification of the DNS  it is evident that  de-occidentalization  and further Internationalization of the corporations and functions that coordinate Internet resources must keep on going further in order to achieve legitimation with the non-Occidentalized world  keeping in mind that the next generation of Internet users will come from non-Occidentalized countries 
Increased governmental participation on Internet Governance  it is evident that worldwide governments are seeking to increase their participation on Internet Ecosystem  something that throws in serious questionings on the balance of power as well as on the future impossibilities of exercising fundamental rights through this medium  Since several years  the United Nations  through the International Telecommunications Union (ITU) had been pushing further with resolutions on several international forums that tend to increase the role of these institutions and their governments adhered on Internet  under the argument of reducing the digital divide  Specifically  several Governments are pushing for ITU to take the technical coordination functions currently delegated to ICANN  which formalized in the matter of multilateral treaties will pave the way for governments to control their local Internet Ecosystems through aggressive regulatory measures  ITU being and international organization its eminently State-centric and only gives voice and vote to the Governments affiliated  the rest only given the status of observatory participants  The risk this poses is to give Governments wide abilities to impose their own policies via unilateral ways and not through multistakeholder participation  even given the chance to violate fundamental Internet principles (neutrality  free flow of data  descentralized administration  free and voluntary adoption and coordination  transjurisdiccional)  On other fronts  these multilateral treaties are not only aimed to move the technical coordination abilities  but rather are focused on very specific topics such as intellectual property and Internet regulation  such as the Transpacific Partnership Agreement (TPP) being currently negotiated 
Developing countries participation on Internet Governance  In line with reducing the digital divide  and increasing the integration of developing countries individuals to the Information Society  several regional specific strategies must be followed and endorsed by the organizations of the global Ecosystem to increase the digital inclusion of these individuals  The UN through the WSIS process  ICANN and several countries have started regional and country specific strategies aimed at this objective 
Widespread Governmental espionage  Edward Snowdens revelations shed light on something widely known but never spoken before  no Internet user is safe from espionage on the Internet and thus security has taken widespread relevance  as the user struggles not to lose confidence on Internet 
On Internet Governance Principles
On a general basis  the next principles should be endorsed 
   Wide protection of Human Rights in the digital era  Recognizing the Internet’s contribution to self-expression and information sharing  we call for Internet governance models to promote this free flow of information as recognized by the Joint Declaration on Freedom of Expression and the Internet  and the United Nations Human Rights Council  
   Non-discriminatory and inclusive access to the Internet as stated in the Declaration of Principles  Building the Information Society  a global challenge in the new Millennium (WSIS)  
   The right of access to information and freedom expression where no law or authority may establish censorship  restricting freedom of dissemination 
   Promote effective competition in telecommunications and ICT services and promote anti-trust policies and regulations 
   Strengthen the integration to the Information Society 
   Consider telecommunications as a worldwide public service of general interest  understanding that Internet does not fall within the realm of Telecommunications regulation principles  and therefore needs a multi-stakeholder approach to its governance  while recognizing its open  distributed  interoperable  and interconnected nature  Internet is rather something entirely different  a logical mechanism of data-packet commutation based on the utilization of TCP IP protocol which uses the Telecommunications infrastructure as a physical mean disregarding the type of infrastructure involved or the physical borders between these  and that according to the ‘layers principle’  works as a superior layer mounted above an inferior telecommunications layer and therefore operates with a separate set of rules for its engagement by the several stakeholders    Joint Declaration on Freedom of Expression and the Internet   Freedom of expression applies to the Internet  as it does to all means of communication  Restrictions on freedom of expression on the Internet are only acceptable if they comply with established international standards  including that they are provided for by law  and that they are necessary to protect an interest which is recognised under international law    There should be no discrimination in the treatment of Internet data and traffic  based on the device  content  author  origin and or destination of the content  service or application 
  United Nations Human Rights Council   Affirms that the same rights that people have offline must also be protected online  in particular freedom of expression  which is applicable regardless of frontiers and through any media of one’s choice  in accordance with articles    of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Right 
  Declaration of Principles  Building the Information Society  a global challenge in the new Millennium (WSIS)   Connectivity is a central enabling agent in building the Information Society  Universal  ubiquitous  equitable and affordable access to ICT infrastructure and services  constitutes one of the challenges of the Information Society and should be an objective of all stakeholders involved in building it  
   Inviolability of the private communications  recognizing the necessary and proportionate principles upon which governments should design and limit their ability to collect information on Internet users based on users’ reasonable privacy interests and the impact on trust in the Internet       Multistakeholder participation on the basis of equal footing  equal voice and equal participation in recognition of each stakeholder's role and responsibility that this model of decentralized administration confers and considering that the multi-stakeholder model approach to Internet governance and technical management has allowed the Internet to grow and flourish into the critical global platform it is today  We recognize that all stakeholders should be included in governance decisions as stated in the Montevideo Statement on the Future of Internet Cooperation  and the Declaration of Principles  Building the Information Society  a global challenge in the new Millennium (WSIS)      Protecting consumers and encourage users to organize themselves for the better care of their interest 
Roadmap for the Further Evolution of the Internet Governance Ecosystem
The following must be followed to enhance Internet Governance landscape 
   IGF shall be kept as the main forum where all stakeholders can participate and disseminate the good practices and lessons learned  Similar efforts at regional and national level should be a practical recommendation 
   United Nations System through the Internet Governance Forum (IGF)  appointed by the United Nations General Assembly through the Tunis Agenda  should be continuously following and monitoring the emerging issues where a global public policy could be necessary to be adopted  and address the appropriate body to handle with each matter  and their measures that facilitate the multistakeholder involvement should be improved  In this sense  we encourage the UN to renew the IGF mandate for another    years  in addition to the permanent evolution and continuity of the Multistakeholder Advisory Group (MAG)  in recognition of the thorough  objective and inclusive representation of the wide diversity of stakeholders involved on the Internet 
   The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) should evolve to comprise a
  Report of the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression  Frank La Rue   Legislation must stipulate that State surveillance of communications must only occur under the most exceptional circumstances and exclusively under the supervision of an independent judicial authority 
  Montevideo Statement on the Future of Internet Cooperation    (   ) identified the need for ongoing effort to address Internet Governance challenges  and agreed to catalyze community-wide efforts towards the evolution of global multistakeholder Internet cooperation  
  Declaration of Principles  Building the Information Society  a global challenge in the new Millennium (WSIS)   Governments  as well as private sector  civil society and the United Nations and other international organizations have an important role and responsibility in the development of the Information Society and  as appropriate  in decision-making processes  Building a people-centred Information Society is a joint effort which requires cooperation and partnership among all stakeholders  
more internationalized organization under the most suitable regime for multi-stakeholder participation  on the basis of equality  openness  bottom-up and rough consensus  on the understanding that the proper application of these within the organizational structures will avoid control by any particular stakeholder  The same should be endorsed for the internationalization of the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) functions currently under ICANN administration by contract with the US Department of Commerce (US DoC)  on the common understanding that these characteristics should be aimed on maintaining the technical stability and resilience of the root  prevailing the notion that due to its technical complexity the technical community should continue their activities on the above supervision of IANA  disregarding to which superior organization this function is endorsed  As Internet policy discussions become more global in nature  stakeholders should continue to rely on the existing structures to develop global policies that benefit all users rather than relying on either the creation of another governance body or on multilateral means 
   All of the stakeholders involved should increase their accountability and transparency practices in favor of the global Internet community public interest  Recognizing necessary improvements within the current governance model  we propose bringing new stakeholders whose voices may not be effectively heard into the conversation  For example  through the offer of fellowships to engineers and policymakers from the developing world to attend multi-stakeholder meetings  as well as improving transparency and accountability  calling on all involved organizations to make relevant governance and policy documents available to all stakeholders at no cost and opening governance meetings to equal participation whenever possible 
   International organizations and governments should enhance their cooperation in order to mitigate any conduct contrary to the use of the Internet for the economic and social development  taking into account the potential for improvements in the international mechanisms of cooperation among stakeholders  In addition  considering that in some cases of Internet Governance  private mechanisms aimed at specific expertise areas and non-State forms of cooperation are currently undergoing and working properly among the stakeholders involved  we recommend that these should be recognized  endorsed  and not duplicated within other State cooperation mechanisms in order to avoid effort duplication and regulation spheres 
   The technical community and International Organizations should continue improving their mutual cooperation for the elaboration of the standards in favor of the interoperability  security and stability of the Internet  We encourage the internet governance community to maintain and endorse the Internet Governance Principles defined by the Technical Community   as follows 
a  Open and inclusive participation 
b  Consensus-based 
c  Permission-less innovation 
d  Collective stewardship and empowerment 
e  Transparency 
f  Pragmatic and evidence-based approach 
g  Voluntary adoption
