German Government  Food for thought  Proposal Global Internet Principles
 
As set out in the goals for this International Multistakeholder meeting on Internet Governance in Sao Paulo  Brazil  on 23/24 of April 2014  the German government wants to take the opportunity to propose a list of Global Internet Principles and properties regarding the management and governance of the internet  to be global in reach and supported by all the relevant stakeholders  i e  governments  civil society  technical community and private sector  There is already a broad range of international documents available that suggest norms  principles and/or guidelines for the management of the internet  However  these are either only supported by some stakeholders or limited in their regional reach 
 
This Sao Paulo meeting offers a rare opportunity to build upon existing documents  consolidated positions  and shared norms and beliefs and have them agreed by a wider range of stakeholders  We consider these Global Internet Principles as an overarching term  given the fact that a global citizen can only enjoy freedom  security and well-being if the governance and use of the internet are in line with the interest of the people  Such a common wide-ranging document may serve as a global reference point to establish political consensus on what is allowed  accepted  and wanted with regard to the use of the internet 
 
Overall  it is important to clarify that the same rights that people have offline must also be protected online  To this end  it is crucial that the internet retains its open  free and global nature 
 
Democratically elected governments  as the representative of the people  possess public authority including internet-related public policy issues and are supposed to be the main source for legitimacy and democratic legitimation  Hence they have to respect and protect human rights  ensure that the rule of law is respected and that relevant national legislation complies with their obligations under international law  Moreover  they need to ensure that the appropriate basic conditions both in terms of cyber-security and technical provisions are in place  Civil society serves  and should continue to do so  as a facilitator and notably as a source of empowerment and credibility  especially at community level  The private sector and particularly the technical community significantly influence and encourage the development  distribution and accessibility of the internet  and should continue to do so  In order to fully live up to the potentials for economic growth  innovation  freedom of expression  access to information and ideas and democratic participation in a knowledge society  all stakeholders involved need to work together 
 
The following list of principles finds its inspiration  among others  in the UN GA resolution on the right to privacy in the digital age (2013)  the UN Human Rights Council resolution  The promotion  protection and enjoyment of human rights on the Internet  (2012)  the OECD Principles for Internet Policy Making (2011)  the Council of Europe Declaration by the Committee of Ministers on Internet governance principles (2011)  the G8 Declaration issued in Deauville (2011)  the  ROAM -principles developed by the UNESCO  the COMPACT principles proposed by the European Commission  and the Principles for the Governance and Use of the Internet developed by CGI br 
 
(1)    The global  open and free nature of the Internet as a single commons has to be ensured  It is a driving force for progress towards development in its various forms including economic growth  encouraging innovation and allowing for creativity  [adjusted from UN  OECD  open  distributed  interconnected  CoE and G8 similar  also similar ROAM  COMPACT]
 
(2)    The same rights that people have offline must also be protected online  [UN] Consistency and effectiveness in privacy protection have to be strengthened at a global level  Although concerns about public security may justify gathering and protection of certain sensitive information  unlawful or arbitrary surveillance and/or interception of communications  as well as unlawful or arbitrary collection of personal data  as highly intrusive acts  may violate the rights to privacy  freedom of expression and access to information  [adopted from UN  OECD  similar also UK paper on roles for governments in ITU]
 
(3)    Access to the Internet should respect the principles of non-discrimination  transparency and openness  [adjusted from OECD  similar G8; CGI br  CoE; OECD]
 
(4)    All stakeholders working together  cooperating in policy development processes and on internet governance arrangements  each in their respective roles and with specific responsibilities  respect these principles and refrain from any measure which may violate human rights  undermine equal and democratic participation  disrespect the rule of law or compromise the global and open nature of the internet  [adjusted from CoE  similar G8  CGI br  COMPACT]
 
(5)    The rule of law must be the foundation for legislation and normative development online  States must ensure full compliance with their obligations under international law 
 
(6)    Cultural and linguistic diversity can foster the development of local content  regardless of language or script  notwithstanding the universality of human rights  [adjusted from CoE  similar CGI br  also UK paper on roles for governments in ITU]
 
(7)    Individual empowerment is a key resource and further efforts to strengthen it have to be undertaken  not only with regard to education  knowledge  health and infrastructure  but also with regard to an accessible  affordable  stable  reliable and secure digital environment  [adjusted from OECD  CoE and G8  similar also UK paper on roles for governments in ITU] To this end  technically advanced states should endeavor to support appropriate capacity building in digitally less advanced states where needed and ensure that exchange is based on locally appropriate approaches  [adopted among others from  G8]
 
(8)    Decision-taking processes in the realm of Internet Governance need to be transparent and fair and include all stakeholders in their respective role ensuring that decision-makers are held accountable for their decisions  [adjusted from OECD  similar G8  COMPACT]
 
(9)    The security  stability  robustness and resilience of the Internet as well as its ability to evolve should be a key objective of internet governance  [adjusted from CoE  similar CGI br]
 
(10)    The technical community as well as the private sector should retain their leading role in the day-to-day management of technical and operational matters in the management of the internet  decentralised in character  [adjusted from CoE]

U S  Government Submission for NETmundial
The Government of the United States of America appreciates the opportunity to
participate in the  Global Multi-stakeholder Meeting on the Future of Internet
Governance   or NETmundial  We commend the effort of the Brazilian government in
coordination and consultation with the global Internet community to convene this
meeting  We look forward to participating in meaningful discussions that generate
support for the evolving multistakeholder framework for the future of Internet
governance 
The United States Government submits the following contribution in response to the
request for views on two topics 
1   Internet governance principles   and
2   A roadmap for the further evolution of the Internet governance ecosystem  
Internet Governance Principles
We understand that the meeting organizers would like participants to reach agreement on
Internet governance principles  Achieving consensus on such a set of principles will
require flexibility  a fair process  and cooperation  Our primary goal is to work with all
stakeholders to achieve shared support for multistakeholder Internet governance 
There is precedent for this effort  as other conferences  organizations  nations  and
individuals have previously compiled high level principles on Internet governance 
Accordingly  we submit that a good starting point for discussions would be the
consideration of principles that are common among these existing efforts and have
already garnered widespread or universal support 
Based on our review of  and participation in  the formulation of various sets of principles 
we note that many of these efforts include the following goals for Internet governance
and policymaking 
(1) Commitment to the multistakeholder approach  with processes rooted in
democratic values  involving the participation of all interested stakeholders  and
occurring in a transparent manner 
(2) Protection of human rights  which apply online just as they do offline 
(3) Promotion of universal and non-discriminatory access to the Internet 
(4) Promotion of the stability  security  interoperability  and functionality of the
network 
(5) Promotion of standard setting  regulatory  and legal environments that support
innovation and avoid unnecessary duplication 
These principles appear in previous works that the U S  has supported  including the
Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development’s (OECD) Council
Recommendations on Principles for Internet Policymaking  the founding declaration for
the Freedom Online Coalition  and the Deauville G8 declaration  These goals are also the
basis for many independent sets of principles  notably including the Brazilian Internet
Steering Committee’s (CGI br) principles and the United States’ International Strategy
for Cyberspace  as well as many other documents from civil society and other
stakeholders  We welcome the consideration of additional similar common principles 
We believe it is wise to avoid excessive deliberation on issues known to divide
participants beyond a distance that can reasonably be bridged in two days  For example 
we would discourage meeting participants from debating the reach or limitations of state
sovereignty in Internet policy  We are optimistic that NETmundial can meaningfully
contribute to the development of Internet governance principles by focusing on those
topics that enjoy broad support 
A roadmap for the further evolution of the Internet Governance ecosystem
The High Level Panel on Global Internet Cooperation and Governance Mechanisms is
currently convening to review the multistakeholder system of Internet governance and
propose recommendations for future growth and evolution  We understand that the panel
will construct proposals for discussion during NETmundial  We look forward to
considering these proposals and we appreciate the other multistakeholder efforts to
explore opportunities for positive  inclusive evolution and cooperative problem solving 
Ultimately  the Internet’s global multistakeholder community should work cooperatively
on continuing to improve and evolve the Internet governance ecosystem  The more open
and inclusive the approach  the greater the legitimacy the system will have 
The United States government believes that existing multistakeholder institutions deserve
significant credit for the Internet’s global growth and dynamism and should remain the
cornerstones of the Internet governance ecosystem  Multistakeholder organizations
should continue to evolve alongside changing technologies and stakeholder needs and to
address all relevant opportunities and challenges  Governments should participate
meaningfully in this system  and may also play an enabling or facilitating role to help the
multistakeholder system to function well  Finally  governments should ensure that the
proper incentives and environment are in place domestically so that a single 
interoperable Internet can flourish globally  enabling freedom of expression and
economic prosperity

Internet Governance Principles

 

1  The United Kingdom Government recognises that a number of organisations have developed different kinds of internet principles over recent years  including the UN Human Rights Council  the OECD  the Council of Europe  the G8  the European Commission  the Internet Rights and Principles Coalition and CGI br  These principles all bring diverse and valuable perspectives to the debate  We should not lose sight of rich store of thinking and the range of viewpoints that it provides  Nevertheless  building a consensus at global level on a set of high level principles offers an important opportunity to establish common ground 

 

2  Of course  a set of high level principles on their own will not be able to solve the many complex issues that the development of the internet has created or harness the many opportunities that the internet offers  There will always be differences of view and challenging problems to address  But provided that such principles identify areas of genuine global consensus  they could act as a valuable guide to how we should approach discussions in the future about internet governance issues and as a useful global reference point for those discussions 

 

3  There are two main reasons why it is important that any set of principles is high-level  First  the internet and how people use the internet is continually evolving and changing  It is crucial that any set of global principles should be future-proof and technology neutral  If they are too detailed and specific to the challenges we face today  they will quickly become out of date as technology and society changes  Secondly  if the principles are to be useful then it is important that there is genuine consensus among all stakeholders around the world  the more agreement there is  the more useful they will be  A smaller number of high level principles will be more effective than a longer list of detailed statements 

 

4  The development of a set of high level principles should start by considering the principles which have already been developed and seek from them to identify common ground  In the view of the United Kingdom  the principles developed by CGI br offer a very good place to start  Some of these Brazilian principles have not attracted support from all stakeholders  and some of the language they use could be brought more fully into line with the multi-stakeholder model which was confirmed at the World Summit on the Information Society  Nevertheless  many of these Brazilian principles have attracted widespread support  It may be helpful to take them as a starting point for discussions to identify a small number of high-level principles around which we can build long-lasting global consensus 

 

Roadmap for the Further Evolution of the Internet Governance Ecosystem

 

The multi-stakeholder model

 

5  One of the key reasons for the success of the internet has been its multi-stakeholder model of governance and the United Kingdom continues unequivocally to support that model  The multi-stakeholder model needs to continue to adapt and evolve in order to remain fit for purpose  Indeed  one of the strengths of this model is its flexibility  The internet has always adapted and changed and will continue to do so  often very quickly  and it is important that its governance model is also able to adapt  There is a significant risk that attempts to codify and set in stone the exact roles and responsibilities of each stakeholder will introduce an inflexible structure which is unable to respond effectively to emerging challenges and opportunities and which will stifle the dynamism and innovation of the internet 

 

6  The Internet Governance Forum (IGF) has played an important role in bringing stakeholders together to discuss issues  develop consensus and identify solutions  The IGF needs to find ways to become more easily navigable  however  to have more structured discussions and lead to clearer outputs  The development of dynamic coalitions is a good example of how relevant stakeholders can come together to address specific issues and this should be encouraged  A strengthened secretariat capacity could also help in this process and help ensure that all stakeholders are able effectively to participate  Initiatives such as the European Commission’s GIPO initiative could also help to make it easier for stakeholders who do not have significant resources to navigate and engage in multi-stakeholder processes more easily 

 

Capacity building

 

7  There is arguably a need for a culture change in the internet governance eco-system  Discussions on internet governance too often lose sight of the need to support stakeholders who do not have significant resources and the need for capacity building in the developing world and emerging economies  Better communications and access to new markets can drive economic development in remote and deprived communities around the world  Services such as e-health and e-education can offer benefits to millions of people  The internet could transform lives in the developing world far more radically than it has in the developed world  We all have a responsibility to focus on these opportunities 

 

8  It is important that international internet organisations are open to the needs and concerns of stakeholders from developing countries and that their processes are navigable and accessible  In Europe  market liberalisation has brought about a transformation in telecommunication services  This  together with appropriate regulation to shield networks and platforms from liability for content transmitted by third parties  has created an environment in which new services can start and grow  More attention and support is needed to help developing countries to open up their markets and reduce the costs of connectivity by adopting proportionate licensing and regulatory regimes which encourage companies to invest in networks  Local internet exchange points  for example  can play a major role in promoting more efficient traffic routing  reducing costs and encouraging the development of more local content  but they are too often held back by disproportionate licensing requirements on themselves or their participants  Our debates should pay more attention to practical measures such as these which offer the potential to change the lives of millions of people 

 

Mainstreaming internet issues

 

9  The internet affects almost every aspect of modern life and organisations across the world have had to adapt to it and change their ways of working in order to make the most of its opportunities or respond to the challenges it brings  The United Kingdom does not believe that we need to identify or create a single international organisation to oversee the internet or deal with internet issues  There is a risk that such a centralising  compartmental approach would disconnect existing international organisations from the internet issues that affect them and mean that some relevant stakeholders are excluded  It may lead at best to duplication of work and at worst to confusion about overlapping mandates 

 

10  Increasingly it is not possible to identify  internet issues  – the internet has become so fundamental that there are simply issues  At the international level  organisations such as WTO  WIPO and Interpol are addressing internet issues relevant to their mandates and this should be continued  The United Kingdom believes we should promote an agenda of mainstreaming internet issues into existing processes and organisations at every level in order to ensure that issues are addressed thoroughly and that all stakeholders are able to contribute in an informed way 

 

Globalisation of internet resources

 

11  The United Kingdom supports a single  un-fragmented internet and considers that compelling the localisation of the internet would risk undermining the economic and social benefits that the internet has brought  It is clear that internet resources are becoming more truly global  The development of the internet was originally based in the United States and at first most internet traffic was routed through servers in the US  But as the number of internet users around the world has increased  so the architecture of the internet has adapted  Capacity to deploy and use the internet has developed and grown around the world and the pattern of internet traffic is radically changing  There is significantly more internal routing within and between different regions of the world and the proportion of traffic which is routed via the US is falling substantially  Increased submarine cable capacity will greatly accelerate this trend in the coming years 

 

12  ICANN is already taking steps to globalise  reflecting these changes  and the United Kingdom continues to support it and support this process  We need to ensure that ICANN remains primarily a technical organisation with a clear remit and that it concentrates on carrying out its remit effectively  taking into account the views of all stakeholders  The Affirmation of Commitments has been a welcome step forward in globalising ICANN’s accountability  That process should continue  and self-assessment and peer review mechanisms can also play a valuable role  Discussions on how to improve the working methods of ICANN’s Governmental Advisory Committee have been very valuable  At the same time  however  we need to ensure that ICANN’s role does not become the subject of political debates and guard against expanding ICANN’s remit into other policy issues 

 

13  It is likely that there will come a time when it is appropriate for the management of the domain name system and the IANA function to be fully globalised  That process needs to be one of responsible evolution  It is crucial that any new arrangements for managing the IANA function should not be politicised  The internet has become an essential tool in nearly all aspects of life and the robustness and reliability of the internet and the proper functioning of the domain name system and the root zone of the internet is of fundamental importance  The internet works under the current arrangements  It has proven to be robust and there is no reason to suggest that it will not continue to be so  It needs to be demonstrated that any development in the current management of internet resources will ensure that the internet will continue to work as effectively and reliably 

 

14  Any proposals for new arrangements need to be carefully scrutinised and tested and have broad multi-stakeholder consensus  The development and critical examination of proposals for change in such an important set of functions is a significant piece of work which will require time and informed consideration  The Global Multi-stakeholder Meeting in Sao Paulo should play a useful role in helping to identify the serious questions that any new proposal would need to answer and the tests that would need to be applied to it  including the extent to which any new arrangement would help or hinder the operation of an open  global internet  The meeting could help to identify a multi-stakeholder process of informed discussion and scrutiny which could begin to address these issues thoroughly as part of an evolutionary development in the globalisation of internet resources 

 

15  It is easy simply to call for change  It is much more difficult to develop a new and better model than the one which we have now  The United Kingdom hopes that the meeting in Sao Paulo will be able to make a positive and informed contribution and help to take this debate forward in a constructive way  

Global Multi-stakeholder Meeting on the Future of Internet Governance
Sao Paulo 23-24 April 2014
Submission by Government of Sweden on Internet Governance Principles
Our core message  we must safeguard a free  open and secure internet and the global multi-stakeholder model for internet governance 
A global agreement on the following core issues are intended to safeguard the open and secure internet  characterised by freedom and innovation without restrictions  continuously developing through a global multi-stakeholder model for internet governance  with the purpose to ensure continued productivity and global economic growth  social prosperity and benefits for all 
***
Human rights and the rule of law
The same rights that people have offline must also be protected online 
Freedom of expression is a cornerstone in a democratic society and its full enjoyment on the Internet is of paramount importance  The right to share opinions on the Internet forms an essential part in increasing individuals’ ability for effective participation in public as well as private discourse 
Internet governance arrangements must ensure the protection of all fundamental rights and freedoms and affirm their universality  indivisibility  interdependence and interrelation in accordance with international human rights law  They must also ensure full respect for democracy and the rule of law and should promote sustainable development  All public and private actors should recognise and uphold human rights and fundamental freedoms in their operations and activities  as well as in the design of new technologies  services and applications  They should be aware of developments leading to the enhancement of  as well as threats to  fundamental rights and freedoms  and fully participate in efforts aimed at recognising newly emerging rights 
The rule of law must be the foundation for legislation and normative development for all conduct online  States must ensure full compliance with their obligations under international law 
Government surveillance of electronic communication must be carried out with respect for human rights at all times and in line with a body of fundamental principles including legality  legitimate aim  necessity  proportionality  judicial authority  transparency and public oversight 
Multi-stakeholder governance
The development and implementation of Internet governance arrangements should ensure  in an open  transparent and accountable manner  the full participation of users  civil society  the private sector  the technical community and governments  The development of international Internet-related public policies and Internet governance arrangements should enable full and equal participation of all stakeholders from all countries 
Responsibilities of states
States have rights and responsibilities with regard to international Internet-related public policy issues  In the exercise of their sovereignty rights  states should  subject to international law  refrain from any action that would directly or indirectly harm persons or entities outside of their territorial jurisdiction  Furthermore  any national decision or action amounting to a restriction of fundamental rights should comply with all obligations in international law and in particular be based on law  be necessary in a democratic society and fully respect the principles of proportionality and the right of independent appeal and surrounded by appropriate legal and due process safeguards 
Empowerment of Internet users
Users should be fully empowered to exercise their fundamental rights and freedoms  make informed decisions and participate in Internet governance arrangements  in particular in governance mechanisms and in the development of Internet-related public policy  in full confidence and freedom 
Universality of the Internet
Internet-related policies should recognise the global nature of the Internet and the objective of universal access  Policies should not adversely affect the unimpeded flow of transboundary Internet traffic 
Security of the Internet
The security  stability  robustness and resilience of the Internet as well as its ability to evolve should be the key objectives of Internet governance  In order to preserve the integrity and ongoing functioning of the Internet infrastructure  as well as users’ trust and reliance on the Internet  it is necessary to promote national and international multi-stakeholder co-operation 
Security concerns must be addressed from a growth- and freedom-oriented  participative  bottom-up perspective that has human rights at its core  Security and freedom should be seen as mutually reinforcing concepts  not as a balancing act 
Decentralised management
The technical community as well as the private sector should retain their leading role in the day-to-day management of technical and operational matters in the management of the Internet  decentralised in character 
Architectural principles
The open standards and the interoperability of the Internet as well as its end-to-end nature should be preserved  These principles should guide all stakeholders in their decisions related to Internet governance  There should be no unreasonable barriers to entry for new users or legitimate uses of the Internet  or unnecessary burdens which could affect the potential for innovation in respect of technologies and services 
Open Internet
Users should have the greatest possible access to Internet-based content  applications and services of their choice  whether or not they are offered free of charge  using suitable devices of their choice  Traffic management measures which have an impact on the enjoyment of fundamental rights and freedoms  in particular the right to freedom of expression and to impart and receive information regardless of frontiers  as well as the right to respect for private life  must meet the requirements of international law on the protection of freedom of expression and access to information  and the right to respect for private life 
Cultural and linguistic diversity
Preserving cultural and linguistic diversity and fostering the development of local content  regardless of language or script  should be key objectives of Internet-related policy and international co-operation  as well as in the development of new technologies 

Message from the Multi-stakeholder Advisory Group (MAG) coming from MAG meeting which took place in Geneva  Switzerland from 19-20 February 

 

The NETmundial meeting and the concerns that led to its creation were part of the public discussions during the IGF in Bali  in October 2013  Members of the MAG look forward to the discussions in Sao Paulo in April 2014 and consider it one among many important fora and events this year that will address Internet governance issues  

 

The IGF has already proven its relevance; already several dozen national and regional IGF platforms have been created  covering all continents   As NetMundial is discussing global IG principles and the evolution of the Internet multistakeholder ecosystem  we urge that the concept of multistakeholder discussion platform of Internet governance related issues as embodied in the IGF should be incorporated in recommendations for any future arrangements 

 

We also recognize that discussions of this nature are  underway in many other fora including the WSIS+10 Review process  the UN CSTD WGEC  CSTD in June  and within a number of the UN agencies and in many other fora 

 

 

The MAG and all stakeholders are in the process of implementing the improvements and enhancements agreed to through the CSTD WG on Improvements to the IGF  and there are ongoing discussions within the MAG regarding strengthening the role and effectiveness of the IGF  

 

We have started our open consultation process in preparation for the 2014 IGF in Istanbul with the express intent of including in the IGF program open  multistakeholder consideration of outputs from the NETmundial meeting and other fora as outlined above  IGF looks forward to inviting representatives from the NETmundial meeting and other appropriate fora and processes to report on and discuss their work and outcomes in Istanbul 

Honorable Colleagues!

 

I propose to bring the following topics to the agenda of the NET mundial in São Paulo 

 
1  Coordinated strategies for effective Internet governance
 

Internet has penetrated into all spheres of human life  and it became oneof the most important means to ensure human rights and democracy  However it carries equally important threats  The incident with Snowden has demonstrated a complete lack of security and control  The necessity to protect the rights of the citizens causes the actions of the states to establish legal framework for relations arising while using the Internet  But the attempts to create legislation in this sphere are not systematic  that can lead to negative consequences  taking into account the cross-border nature of the Internet  The task of creating legislation in this sphere must be systematic and must be achieved by concerted actions of all the states to develop a unified international legally binding legislation   

 
2  Protection of users rights

 

Today the world faced with widespread violation of human rights on the web  These violations are global  worldwide and appear as from the individual states and also from major transnational companies  criminal groups and individuals  This situation tends to undermine confidence on the Internet by users and threatens with fragmentation of the Network  For many governments inability to protect the rights of their citizens may become a pretext for creating protective barriers  There are many such examples already  International community must find ways to deal with violations of the rights of users  before such a practice has not become commonplace  in order to preserve the integrity  freedom and openness of the Internet  The States  together with other stakeholders  should find the frameworks of the protection of the rights of users and ensure the protection of these rights in those areas in which the States have the exclusive authority and responsibility 

 
3  The evolution of the Internet ecosystem

 

The future of Internet is foggy  Traditionally  we see the Internet in its static  current state  But the Internet ecosystem is constantly developing  New technologies  new challenges  new stakeholders appear  The influence of some stakeholders reduces and the influence of others increases 

 

There is no single global approach to determination of the policy and direction of development in this area  It is necessary to define a unified conceptual apparatus for all objects and processes of the Internet  and the very definition of Internet governance  Applying the multistakeholder approach  it is necessary to determine the degree of responsibility of each of the sides of interaction  Currently this is not done 

 

It leads to the fact that there are different groups that claim to have a right to decide what will be the future of the Internet  However  decision-making in this area requires a broader discussion and consensus than some meetings behind the closed doors  IGF is perfectly suited for this  exactly IGF  but not the elite groups that are able to determine the vector of development of Internet governance 

 

At a forum in Istanbul it is essential to discuss – how we see the evolution of "Internet" ecosystem governance  what principles will be used for this  to listen to the opinions of stakeholders and  perhaps  apply on this occasion  

 
4  Critical Internet resources governance  IANA  Quest for the Rest
 

To date  the World Wide Web has proven its stability  The critical infrastructure  in particular  the system DNS  is stable  However  in future individual outdated control system elements pose a threat to the sustainable development of the Internet  For example  the control of one government for the root zone governance system that performs IANA  It worries the international community  In the future  the alternative scenario of the DNS implementation is possible  In addition  the lack of transparency undermines the credibility of the entire control system of the critical infrastructure of the Internet as a whole 

 

In general  the IANA functions quite effectively  That’s why it is proposed to include to the agenda of the Internet Governance Forum the issue of necessity to review the contract and the relevant IANA procedures for its implementation 

 

The next step in this direction should be discussion of the creation of a working group that will develop proposals for the formation of an international body for oversight and audit IANA  

 

Such a body should have appropriate technical competencies and enjoy the wider international community confidence  Its activities should be based on the agreement providing the mechanism of accountability  and be entirely focused on protecting the public interest 

 
5  Clarifying the role and authority of governments

 

Internet is transboundary  But national states have fixed and clearly defined boundaries within which they spread their laws and economic rules  They can not avoid affecting the legal entities using the Internet  Each country solves problems of security  intellectual property  and distribution of domains  Internet is used and for political purposes differently  These issues can be determined on the international level through conventions and treaties  but more often it does not  This process should be activated  Therefore it is necessary to define what should be regulated at the international level  and to what extent the Internet can be controlled independently  

 
6  Ethical Issues in the Informational Environment

 

Enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights the principle of freedom of speech is a fundamental basis of the Internet functioning   It is a global information environment that provides free cross-border flow and exchange of information  However  such conceptual documents as the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms of the Council of Europe states that realization of these freedoms in a democratic society imposes duties and responsibilities established by law 

 

Finding a balance between the informational human rights and the principle of their restrictions for protection of these rights and the rights of third parties is a challenge for all stakeholders involved in Internet governance 

 

The right to freedom of information exchange in the network must be protected from excessive restrictions and controls  Including against unauthorized surveillance  It places special responsibility on the state as the guarantor of the rights of both the national and international level 

 

Therefore  at the present stage of development of the Internet  global Internet communities need to revert to the ethical principles in the field of information and mechanisms for their implementation   The platform for dialogue on the issue could be the Internet Governance Forum   In addition  the Forum should explore the possibility of analyzing and making appropriate recommendations by forces created in 2012 by the Working Group on the Principles of the Internet (Working Group on Internet Principles)

Norwegian contribution to the Sao Paulo meeting
Norway welcomes this opportunity to provide our input in this discussion on the future of internet governance  The internet is a driving force for global economic growth  innovation  efficient communication and open dialogue  Internet has opened up for new ways to interact between governments and its citizens  for new ways to run businesses and for new ways to develop democracy and for individuals to exercise their universal rights  Herein lie the core values – and the challenges – of the internet 
Internet Governance principles
1  Many important principles for Internet Governance have been developed within different organizations  with different perspectives  The Council of Europe Declaration by the Committee of Ministers on Internet Governance principles has a human rights perspective  the OECD Council Recommendation on Principles for Internet Policy Making has an economic perspective  the Brazilian Internet Steering Committee CGI br has also developed principles for the Governance and use of the Internet  All the mentioned principles  other Internet Governance principles not mentioned and previous discussions on principles  including the newly published Communication from the European Commission and the UN Human Rights council are among the organizations that have provided principles that can contribute to guidance and perspectives in the development of global Internet Governance principles 
2  Global Internet Governance principles should take into account universal principles that will apply regardless of conditions and events  Further  Global Internet Governance principles should be applicable regardless of the technological  social and cultural developments that lie ahead of us  For the Internet Governance principles to be truly global  they must be supported by all relevant stakeholders  Flexibility and good will from all stakeholders will be required in order to achieve such a global consensus 
3  Against this background  Norway proposes that the global Internet Governance principles should be directed at the following 
a  Promoting an open  free  global  robust  secure and resilient Internet 
b  Respecting universal human rights and fundamental freedoms 
c  Complying with international law and legislation as implemented in the off-line world  including the right to privacy 
d  Sustaining the flexibility inherent in the multi-stakeholder model for developing policy  with a view to ensuring that all relevant stakeholders are included and can participate and contribute 
e  Enhancing democratic values such as accountability  non-discrimination  transparency  representativeness and openness 
f  Respecting and addressing public interests for the benefit of all internet users 
A roadmap for the further evolution of the Internet Governance Ecosystem
1  The Internet Governance Ecosystem consists of many different organizations and stakeholders  Internet Governance is addressed at several international arenas and at various levels  One important arena for dialogue is the Internet Governance Forum (IGF)  Regional initiatives such as the Latin America and Caribbean Internet Governance Forum (LACIGF)  the European Dialogue on Internet Governance (EuroDig) and other regional and national initiatives listed on the IGF website are also useful arenas  among others 
2  For the further evolution of the Internet Governance ecosystem the implementation of agreed global principles will be essential  These global principles should form the basis of the practical implementation for processes  rules and procedures in the existing multi-stakeholder organizations and other organization that have a role in the Internet Governance ecosystem 
3  The multi-stakeholder model can continue to be developed  This could include more accountability  respect and sensitivity for the different public policies in multi-stakeholder organizations  Participation of all stakeholders should also be ensured and greater transparency should be introduced 
4  In certain areas there is an information overflow and a remedy for this to enable stakeholders to be properly informed  should be promoted  The recommendations from CSTD WG on improvements to the IGF should be utilized to strengthen IGF as an arena for further dialogue  sharing of best practices and better cooperation  We are also looking forward to the outcome of the CSTD WG on enhanced cooperation  The initiative from the European Commission  the Global Internet Policy Observatory
(GIPO)  can be useful to help all stakeholders keeping track of Internet Governance activities and help stakeholders to identify the important issues 
5  Capacity building in order to enable everybody to utilize the full potential the internet has for economic growth and development  will be crucial and should be promoted in a Roadmap  Capacity building should not be an issue for states alone  We should find the best ways and the best mechanisms for efficient capacity building by drawing on the resources and the competence from a number of stakeholders 
6  The recommendations proposed in the report from Affirmation of Commitment review teams should be addressed to improve the accountability and transparency of ICANN and to improve further processes and stakeholder participation in ICANN 
7  Further globalization of ICANN and the IANA-function has been called for and steps have already been taken in this regard  Norway welcomes and supports such a process whilst acknowledging that due consideration must be given to the security and stability of the DNS 
8  ICANN’s Governmental Advisory Committee (GAC) provides an important channel in which governments can raise their public policy concerns to the attention of ICANN  We believe that an efficient GAC benefits us all  ICANN’s role is a technical one and not a political one  It should remain that way also in the future regardless of how the IANA function will be managed  Thus  ICANN should not be used as an arena for political debates  nor should the IANA function be politicized in any way 

Government of India's Initial Submission to Global Multistakeholder
Meeting on the Future of Internet Governance; Sao Paulo  Brazil on
April 23-24  2014 
Page 1 of 5
General 
1  Internet is a shared resource and a global commons available to public  An open  stable and secure Internet  and unhindered access to information and knowledge  is crucial to global connectivity  innovation and economic development 
2  Internet with its immense transformational potential can provide the means for sustainable and inclusive development in a country in areas such as education  healthcare  financial inclusion and service delivery  The medium of Internet provides voice to the voiceless as never before in the history of mankind  This potential can be realized only by providing universal access and affordable devices  The Digital divide must be relegated to the past – instead  the communities must reap the benefits of the digital dividend  Therefore  we recommend to make a transformational shift from the Internet of today to the  Equinet  of tomorrow 
3  The exponential growth of the Internet and its all encompassing impact on our lives necessitates putting in place an effective and international mechanism to develop  make and implement international public policies in the technical  economic and social  and strategic domains of the Cyber space 
Internet Governance and Management System 
4  Governance of the Internet is quite complex and involves range of issues of varied nature such as technical  legal  public policy  equitable access  privacy and security of the infrastructure and information  Given that the core infrastructure of the Internet is not protected by any international legal regime  it is important to shape a globally acceptable legal regime to maintain the openness  security and international trust in the Internet 
5  The management of Internet encompasses both technical and public policy
issues and should involve all stakeholders and relevant intergovernmental and
international organisations  Policy authority for Internet-related public policy
issues is the sovereign right of states 
6  The Internet Governance should be multilateral  transparent  democratic 
and representative  with the participation of governments  private sector  civil
society  and international organizations  in their respective roles  This should be
one of the foundational principles of Internet Governance 
7  The structures that manage and regulate the core internet resources need
to be internationalized  and made representative and democratic  The
governance of the Internet should also be sensitive to the cultures and national
interests of all nations  The mechanism for Governance of the Internet should
therefore be transparent and should address all related issues  The Internet must
be owned by the global community for mutual benefit and be rendered
impervious to possible manipulation or misuse by any particular stake holder
whether State or non-State 
8  The upcoming WSIS+10 review in 2015 provides a significant opportunity to
build confidence in the international community on Cyber space by rectifying the
gaps in the implementation of Tunis Agenda and by establishing mechanisms to
devise a roadmap and to implement it for effectively addressing emerging
challenges and opportunities by the World Information Society 
9  Recognizing that the Tunis Agenda of 2005 endorsed by the UN General
Assembly created Internet Governance Forum (IGF) as a platform for multistakeholder
policy dialogue  the IGF should continue to enrich such dialogue
among relevant stakeholders 
Internet and Security
10  International law  and in particular the Charter of United Nations  is applicable and is essential in maintaining security and stability and promoting an open  secure  peaceful and accessible ICT environment  All governments should have an equal role and responsibility for ensuring stability  security  and continuity of the Internet 
11  The application of norms derived from existing international law relevant to the use of ICTs by States is an essential measure to reduce risks to international peace  security and stability  Common understandings on how such norms shall apply to State behavior and the use of ICTs by State requires further study  Given the unique attributes of ICTs  additional norms could be developed overtime 
12  Voluntary confidence building measures can promote trust and assurance among States and help reduce the risk of conflict by increasing predictability and reducing misperception  States need to consider ways of cooperation in implementing acceptable norms and principles of responsible behaviour  including the role that may be played by private sector and civil society organizations 
13  Given the pace of ICT development and the scope of the threat  States need to enhance common understandings and intensify practical cooperation through regular institutional dialogue with broad participation under auspices of the United Nations  as well as regular dialogue through bilateral  regional and multilateral fora  and other international organizations 
Cyber security and Cyber crime 
14  Governments  business  organization and individual owner and users of information technologies must assume responsibility for and take steps to enhance the security of the information technologies 
15  Law enforcement cooperation in the investigation and prosecution of international cases of criminal misuse of ICTs in cyberspace should be coordinated among all concerned states  States should intensify cooperation against criminal use of ICTs  harmonize legal approaches as appropriate and strengthen practical collaboration between respective law enforcement and prosecutorial agencies 
16  The global nature of cyber crime requires strengthening of existing and consideration of new national and international legal or other responses to cyber crime 
17  A mechanism for accountability should be put in place in respect of crimes committed in cyberspace  such that the Internet is a free and secure space for universal benefaction  A ‘new cyber jurisprudence’ needs to be evolved to deal with cyber crime  without being limited by political boundaries and cyber-justice can be delivered in near real time 
Capacity building
18  Capacity building is of vital importance to an effective cooperative global effort on securing ICTs and their use 
19  All stakeholders need to facilitate the transfer of information technology and capacity-building to developing countries  in order to help them to take measures to improve cyber-security develop technical skill and appropriate legislation  strategies and regulatory frameworks to fulfil their responsibilities; and bridge the divide in the security of ICTs and their use 
20  International cooperation should be extended for capacity building in areas relevant to the Internet Governance  This includes  in particular  building centres of expertise and other institutions to facilitate knowhow transfer and exchange best practices  in order to enhance the participation of developing countries in Internet governance mechanisms 
Social and Cultural aspects 
21  The same rights that people have offline must also be protected online  in particular freedom of expression which is applicable regardless of frontiers and through any media of one’s choice in accordance with article 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights 
22  All stakeholders commit to work earnestly towards multi lingualization of the Internet  In this context  States also support advances in the process of multi-lingualism in areas including Domain Names  E-mail Addresses and key work look-up 
23  All Stakeholders commit to encourage the development of locally relevant information  applications and services that will benefit developing countries and countries with economies in transition 

Austrian contribution to the
Global Multistakeholder Meeting on
the Future of Internet Governance
 netmundial 
23 and 24 April 2014  Sao Paulo  Brazil
Vienna  6th March  2014
Austria welcomes the opportunity to contribute to the Global Multistakeholder Meeting on the Future of Internet Governance  netmundial  and to the discussion on principles of Internet Governance and on the roadmap for the further evolution of the Internet governance ecosystem 
In particular  Austria expresses her gratitude to the Republic of Brazil for organizing this important conference based on the agreed multistakeholder model in a transparent manner and for providing a valuable set of declarations  statements and other documents on Internet governance principles  thus underlining the importance of this truly global issue and the vast interest of all relevant stakeholders  also to be included also in the future 
Austria is convinced that the Netmundial Conference will offer an opportunity to facilitate consensus in building upon the already existing documents adopted by different stakeholders and international organizations  in particular the UN General Assembly and the UN Human Rights Council  the OECD  the Council of Europe  the Brazilian Internet Steering Committee and the Internet Rights and Principles Coalition 
The single  open  free and global Internet is essential for everyone  in full compliance with human rights and fundamental freedoms  respect for the rule of law and basic conditions for cybersecurity  in order to safeguard the social and economic potential of the Internet for innovation  growth and unfolding the human potential in a democratic society 
Therefore  Austria recalls the WSIS outcome documents 
• the Geneva Declaration of Principles  reaffirming the universality  indivisibility  interdependence and interrelation of all human rights and fundamental freedoms  including the right to development  as enshrined in the Vienna Declaration; reaffirming that democracy  sustainable development  and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms as well as good governance at all levels are interdependent and mutually reinforcing; resolving to strengthen respect for the rule of law in international as in national affairs; reaffirming Art  19 and Art  29 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights  reaffirming the principles of freedom of the press and freedom of information  as well as those of independence  pluralism and diversity of media 
• the Tunis Commitment  reaffirming par  4 5 and 55 of the Geneva Declaration of Principles  recognizing freedom of expression and free flow of information  ideas and knowledge  essential for the Information Society and beneficial to development;
• the Tunis Agenda for the Information Society  in particular
- the continued security and stability of the Internet;
- the respect for the architectural principles of the Internet  including the global
interoperability  openness and the end-to-end principles;
- the need to promote effective competition in the global domain names market;
- the need to guarantee the principle of freedom of expression;
- the increased internationalization of Internet governance as a whole  and of ICANN´s coordination and management of the domain name system in particular 
par  31 recognizing that Internet Governance is an essential element for a people- centered  inclusive  development-oriented and non-discriminatory Information Society; committing to the stability and security of the Internet as a global facility and to ensuring the requisite legitimacy of its governance  based on the full participation of all stakeholders  from both developed and developing countries  within their respective roles and responsibilities;
- among the documents adopted within the UN system  in particular 
the Resolution adopted by the Human Rights Council of the UN on 5 June 2012 on promotion  protection and enjoyment of human rights on the Internet (A/HRC/20/8) 
acknowledging the global and open nature of the Internet 
the GA-Resolution 68/167  The rights of privacy in the digital age   adopted by the UN General Assembly on 18 December 2013 reaffirming the right to privacy  according to which no one shall be subjected to arbitrary or unlawful interference with his/her privacy  family  home or correspondence  and the right to the protection of the law against such interference 
and
the Seoul Declaration for the future of the Internet Economy  adopted on 17/18 June 2008  calling for sustaining the open  decentralized and dynamic nature of the Internet  interoperability  participation and ease of access 
Principles for Internet Policy-making  adopted by the OECD High Level Meeting on the Internet Economy on 28/29 June 2011  and
the Internet Governance Strategy 2012-2015 of the Council of Europe 
We understand that reaching a consensus will provide a positive impetus for further evolution within the UN system and within the Governmental Advisory Committee of ICANN  in view of the extension of the Affirmation of Commitments regarding IANA/ICANN 

Bulgarian Contribution on "Internet Governance Principles" and  "Roadmap for the Further Evolution  of the Internet Governance Ecosystem" as set out in the goals for International Multistakeholder meeting on Internet Governance in Sao Paulo  Brazil  on 23/24 of April 2014

 

Bulgaria supports the efforts of the European Commission to formulate a common position and concept encompassing the main principles for the development  management and governance of the Internet as a major resource for innovation and prosperity  including

 

• The Internet should remain one single unfragmented space  where all resources should be accessible in the same manner  irrespective of the location of the user and the provider

 

• Internet-related discussions and decisions should be based on a strengthened  genuine multi-stakeholder model 

 

• The technical architecture of the Internet has been able to evolve to cope with new and often unforeseen challenges

 

• Confidence in the Internet and its governance is a prerequisite for the realisation of the Internet's potential as an engine for economic growth and innovation

 

• Bulgaria supports the view that the Internet must allow freedom of expression and respect for human rights- fundamental  principles  to democratic societ?

 

Setting the process of globalization of the Internet Governance is one of the most important issues for discussion 

 

Regarding the process related to the globalization of Internet Governance  so as to enable the active participation of national governments  we recommend a serious discussion to be scheduled  in order to provide a critical evaluation of the effect arising from the process  to assess the potential outcomes as well as to prevent retreat of the security  privacy and interoperability criteria 

 

It is considered a good approach to expand the circle of stakeholders in order to stimulate the elaboration of policies on the Information Society and we admire the idea of ??establishing a platform as a Global Internet Policy Observatory (GIPO) on policies regarding the Internet as a suitable form of innovative online resource 

 

As far as the roadmap is concerned  we believe that realistic guidelines can be drawn only after a discussion in Sao Paulo since all aspects of the discussed problem on the extent of transformation as well as the time period of the process will be clarified  there

 

Bulgaria is ready to participate in upcoming discussions  

French Government Submission to NETmundial

 

Initial Roadmap Proposal for the Future of Internet Governance

 

4 March 2014

 

 

 

1       Given the complexity and diversity of Internet issues  Internet governance is getting more and more topical an issue in a growing number of international fora  where the debate tends to focus on the most appropriate model of Internet governance  Ever since the WSIS back in 2003 and 2005  France has been advocating for the multi-stakeholder model with a view to preserving a single  open  free and secure Internet  France also acknowledges that perceived shortcomings of the multi-stakeholder model have offered a context for alternative  some would say more authoritarian  advocacy approaches in favour of more governmental control over the Internet  France is resolute in its intention to address these perceived shortcomings which give weight to an intergovernmental model of Internet governance 

 

2       Now two parallel processes are on the verge of being launched at international level that will affect the future of Internet governance  The WSIS+10 review process by the UN might soon lead to the organization of a high level event  possibly a new summit with negotiated conclusions  in 2015  This eventuality should definitely give the EU a sense of urgency to ensuring the success of the Global Multi-stakeholder Forum on the Future of Internet Governance to be hosted by Brazil in Sao Paulo in late April 2014  For this very reason  France welcomes and wants to join in all recent efforts by other EU Member States  the Commission and EEAS  aimed at reaching a European consensus on the two objectives of the Sao Paulo Forum   (1) crafting Internet governance principles; and (2) proposing a roadmap for the further evolution of the Internet governance ecosystem   Focusing on the second objective  this paper is to be considered as France’s own contribution to a coherent and comprehensive set of European food for thought papers 

 

3       First  as part of the general debate over the future of Internet governance  France reaffirms that in essence  Internet governance cannot but include all stakeholders  Difficulties arise only when considering specific Internet governance issues  primarily on the question of who should assume the leadership role  In areas such as cybersecurity  intellectual property  privacy  consumer protection  child protection or taxation  which governments address through domestic legislation and international treaties  governments clearly dominate the process  although not to the exclusion of other stakeholders  In areas related to the coordination of the Internet technical infrastructure  however  no government can reasonably have a similar leadership or might even have to intervene in the process  Interferences between the coordination of the Internet technical infrastructure and the Internet-related public policies should be avoided through the enhancement of the cooperation and the dialogue between the various relevant entities 

 

4       Second and as a consequence  France maintains that while a global Internet governance ecosystem must obviously include all private organisations responsible for the coordination of the Internet technical infrastructure (the so-called I*  such as the IETF and the RIR)  it also has to make room for the multilateral system (and such fora as ITU  OECD or WIPO)  where governments defend their citizens’ interests in international negotiations on a range of Internet-related public policy issues  Given the growing number of international fora which address ever more complex and diverse Internet issues  a comprehensive roadmap to the further evolution of the Internet governance ecosystem should then also require all stakeholders to agree on a few principles – including the basic principle of subsidiarity  well known from the EU Member States  whereby any Internet governance issue ought to be handled by the smallest body capable of addressing that issue effectively 

 

5       Beyond these considerations which derive from the common multi-stakeholder conceptual approach to Internet governance  France acknowledges that ICANN and the oversight of the Domain Name System (DNS) are  in practice  key points that need to be tackled in the debates on the future of Internet governance  ICANN embodies both the success of the multi-stakeholder model of Internet governance and its shortcomings  France therefore believes that all stakeholders should give every possible consideration to the twofold reasons why ICANN and the oversight of the DNS are so controversial 

 

6       As a late November 13 report by the Congressional Research Service reads   one criticism is fuelled by concerns of many nations that the US government holds undue legacy influence and control over ICANN and the DNS  [*] As the leaders of I* themselves recently called for  accelerating the globalization of ICANN and IANA functions  in their late October 7 Montevideo Statement  France wants to point out that this first shortcoming of the multi-stakeholder model embodied by ICANN does not raise concerns among governments only 

 

7       The other  criticism reflects the tension between national governments and the current performance and governance processes of ICANN  whereby governments feel they lack adequate influence over ICANN decisions that affect a range of Internet policies issues [*]  Indeed  many ICANN decisions affect areas such as intellectual property  privacy or cybersecurity which  governments have addressed for their own citizens through domestic legislation  as well as through international treaties [*]  This second shortcoming gives solid ground to governments who presently support a greater role for governments in the oversight of Internet because they feel their interests are not adequately addressed within ICANN’s multi-stakeholder system  These are very legitimate concerns that no stakeholder should deny  Besides  the feeling that one’s interests are not adequately addressed within ICANN’s multi-stakeholder system is  again  not shared among governments only   The current performance and governance processes of ICANN  also worry all stakeholders who call for more accountability in the Board’s decision-making processes 

 

8       France intends to overcome both criticisms of the multi-stakeholder model embodied by ICANN  In this context  France first welcomes the late February 17 ICANN Board’s resolution to create six President’s Advisory Groups dedicated to enhancing the Affirmation of Commitments  ICANN’s decision-making processes and policy structures  ICANN’s legal structure  processes for root server system  IANA multi-stakeholder accountability  and Internet governance  France supports ICANN President’s work to reshape ICANN  and is looking forward to discussing these Advisory Groups’ recommendations in the next Singapore and London meetings of ICANN 

 

9       Second and accordingly  France is convinced that the roadmap to the future of Internet governance will have to balance the pace of globalizing ICANN  which represents a prior objective  and the oversight of the DNS activities with the pace of bridging ICANN’s gap of accountability before all stakeholders  As far as France is concerned  the overarching goal of the roadmap should be to establish a schedule for making ICANN responsible for the oversight of the DNS by globalising the Affirmation of Commitments and organising the devolution of the IANA functions to ICANN 

 

10   ICANN’s accountability has always been key to confidence in the multi-stakeholder model  As a start  France suggests to work on mitigating the concerns expressed by most stakeholders on the absence of separation of powers within ICANN in general and of binding mechanisms for the Board‘s decisions in particular  In this respect  the provisions of the Affirmation of Commitments and IANA contracts must be considered carefully  as present external constraints over ICANN that should be transferred and internalised within the future ICANN system  Other future accountability mechanisms would have to be designed jointly by all stakeholders so that the ICANN multi-stakeholder system can adequately address their interests 

 

11   France calls for a broad European consensus on this initial roadmap proposal and invites ICANN  the US government  EU  Brazilian authorities and all stakeholders in the High level multi-stakeholder committee of the Sao Paulo forum  and all other partner countries  to engage in a direct dialogue over these concrete goals  In the meantime  France intends to work with all stakeholders to define the conditions under which ICANN can be rendered accountable before them all and achieve the utmost level of international confidence  In doing that  France means to include all the governments who presently support a more intergovernmental approach to Internet governance  so that all stakeholders can already build on the success of the Sao Paulo process in the next WSIS+10 review process 

Commonwealth ICT Ministers Forum 2014

Marlborough House  London

3 - 4 March 2014

Commonwealth Cybergovernance Model

 

 

 
1  Introduction

 

1 1  Recognising the central importance of the internet to Commonwealth members and following the Abuja Declaration of Proposed Commonwealth Cybergovernance Model of 9 October 2013 and subsequent consultations  the Commonwealth Telecommunications Organisation offers this draft set of principles for consideration and adoption during the Commonwealth ICT Ministers Forum  The principles are intended to guide Commonwealth members to plan and implement practical actions in policy development  regulation and legislation  cross-border collaboration  capacity building  technical measures and other operational activities 

 
2  Cyberspace – the internet and more

 

2 1  We are in an era of changing economic circumstances creating both opportunity and uncertainty  giving rise to new trade and economic patterns together with unforeseen threats to peace and security  and a surge in popular demands for democracy  human rights and for broadened social and economic opportunities  Previously unimagined access to information and communication between individuals across our planet is driving economic and social development in the 21st century  Cyberspace provides this access  helping us to bridge the digital divide while influencing every aspect of our economic and social activities Cyberspace is becoming our global central nervous system Cyberspace continues to develop at a pace unparalleled in our history - growth is anticipated from 2bn to 4bn users by 2020  many in developing countries  This pace of change necessitates urgent action in reaching consensus on Cybergovernance 

2 2  Its open  decentralised and distributed nature  that empowers the individual  has fostered innovation  collaboration and rapid development Enjoyment of those benefits relies upon its safety  security and resilience  Cyberspace can also be a vehicle for crime  extremism and other social ills  Governments  industry  civil society and users have a shared responsibility to tackle those threats to society  Necessary security measures may be in tension with the very features that have made Cyberspace a success and  in determining an equitable balance  our behaviour in Cyberspace will benefit from our shared Commonwealth values that govern many aspects of our lives 

 
3  Applying Commonwealth values in Cyberspace

 

3 1  The Commonwealth Charter of March 2013 reflects the values and aspirations which unite the Commonwealth - democracy  development  human rights and the rule of law  The Charter expresses the commitment of member states to the development of free and democratic societies and the promotion of peace and prosperity to improve the lives of all peoples of the Commonwealth  It also acknowledges the role of civil society in supporting the goals and values of the Commonwealth 

3 2  The principles concerning our use of Cyberspace today and the evolving nature of Cyberspace tomorrow should be derived from  should respect and reflect our shared Commonwealth values as set out in the Commonwealth Charter  Within the context of the Charter as a whole  we identify the key characteristics  which led to our principles  as exemplified in Appendix 1  This analysis is based on the principle that what is unacceptable off-line is unacceptable on-line  Priorities for practical action  in accordance with these principles  will depend on the prevailing circumstances in each country 
4  Commonwealth principles for the use of Cyberspace

 

4 1  As we operate in Cyberspace and work with others to shape its continuing development  we will use the following principles to guide our decisions  actions and demonstrate our progress towards meeting these principles  The principles are best considered collectively and not each in isolation without regard to the whole because frequently some are in tension with each other  We reiterate the urgency with which these issues need to be addressed 
Principle 1  We contribute to a safe and an effective global Cyberspace

 

·as a partnership between public and private sectors  civil society and users  a collective creation;

·with multi-stakeholder  transparent and collaborative governance promoting continuous development of Cyberspace;

·where investment in the Cyberspace is encouraged and rewarded;

·by providing sufficient neutrality of the network as a provider of information services;

·by offering stability in the provision of reliable and resilient information services;

·by having standardisation to achieve global interoperability;

·by enabling all to participate with equal opportunity of universal access;

·as an open  distributed  interconnected internet;

·by providing an environment that is safe for its users  particularly the young and vulnerable;

·made available to users at an affordable price 
Principle 2  Our actions in Cyberspace support broader economic and social development

 

·by enabling innovation and sustainable development  creating greater coherence and synergy through collaborationand the widespread dissemination of knowledge;

·respecting cultural and linguistic diversity without the imposition of beliefs;

·we protect the vulnerable in society in their use of Cyberspace;

·we  individually and collectively  understand the consequences of our actions and our responsibility to cooperate to make the shared environment safe; our obligation is in direct proportion to culpability and capability 

 
5  Practical application of these principles

5 1  Each Commonwealth member may find it beneficial to develop individually  a whole of government strategy  reflecting the many facets in making Cyberspace safe  secure  resilient and rewarding  that will address unique local needs of countries with their different regions  sectors and industries and deliver their particular economic and social priorities 

 
Appendix 1  Implications for cyberspace of each element of the Commonwealth Charter

 
a Democracy

Our Charter says   We recognise the inalienable right of individuals to participate in democratic processes  in particular through free and fair elections in shaping the society in which they live    Used effectively  Cyberspace supports participative democracy by offering multiple channels for citizen’s engagement with the democratic process  transparency and accountability of our governments  leading to good governance and a fairer society 

 
b Human Rights

Our Charter says   We are committed to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and other relevant human rights covenants and international instruments  We are committed to equality and respect for the protection and promotion of civil  political  economic  social and cultural rights  including the right to development  for all without discrimination on any grounds as the foundations of peaceful  just and stable societies     The operation of Cyberspace could and should respect  reflect and protect these rights as they are applied both online and offline  Widespread access to information through Cyberspace and the network of stakeholders it could help build  equips societies to protect Human Rights while supporting individuals in their quest for dignified livelihoods 

 
c International peace  security and economic development

Our Charter says   We firmly believe that international peace and security  sustainable economicgrowth and development and the rule of law are essential to the progress and prosperity of all  We are committed to an effective multilateral system based on inclusiveness  equity  justice and international law    Whilst Cyberspace can give rise to some new threats to global peace  it has a significant role to play in engendering international peace by promoting understanding across cultures and communities  respect for international law andadherence to accepted norms of behaviour  The contribution Cyberspace could make to economic development is far more than the already significant contribution it is making  The operation of an open and inclusive Cyberspace  while recognising legitimate economic  security  cultural and social concerns of members  will deliver these Charter outcomes 

 
d Tolerance  respect and understanding

Our Charter says   We emphasise the need to promote tolerance  respect  understanding  moderation and religious freedom which are essential to the development of free and democratic societies  and recall that respect for the dignity of all human beings is critical to promoting peace and prosperity  We accept that diversity and understanding the richness of our multiple identities are fundamental to the Commonwealth’s principles and approach   Cyberspace provides direct person-to-person social interactions between social  ethnic  religious and racial groups and thereby promotes respect for cultural and linguistic diversity  encouraging social development  This can help break down barriers of ignorance  suspicion and prejudice  help protect the vulnerable poor  disabled and rural  supporting these Charter outcomes 

 
e Freedom of Expression

Our Charter says   We are committed to peaceful  open dialogue and the free flow of information  including through a free and responsible media  and to enhancing democratic traditions and strengthening democratic processes   Cyberspace provides the means for unparalleled channels for the free flow of information; its evolution and operation must continue to deliver the means for open and responsible dialogue 

 
f Rule of Law

Our Charter says   We believe in the rule of law as an essential protection for the people of the Commonwealth and as an assurance of limited and accountable government     Our operation and use of Cyberspace must respect the law  the law must comply with international norms  and the law must be capable of protecting the people and property  As Cyberspace develops  Members must participate in the continued development of norms of behaviour and laws 

 
g Good Governance

Our Charter says   We reiterate our commitment to promote good governance through the rule of law  to ensure transparency and accountability and to root out  both at national and international levels  systemic and systematic corruption  Cyberspace can support good governance of our countries through transparency and accountability of government and private sector activities The governance of Cyberspace itself should in turn be inclusive  transparent and accountable with the active participation of governments  private sector and civil society 

 
h Sustainable Development

Our Charter says   We recognise that sustainable development can help to eradicate poverty by pursuing inclusive growth whilst preserving and conserving natural ecosystems and promoting social equity  We stress the importance of sustainable economic and social transformation to eliminate poverty and meet the basic needs of the vast majority of the people of the world and reiterate that economic and social progress enhances the sustainability of democracy  

Cyberspace is a doorway to the global economy and an opportunity for less developed states to participate in world markets  to develop new markets  and to commoditise their resources  promoting economic development 

 We are committed to removing wide disparities and unequal living standards as guided by internationally agreed development goals  We are also committed to building economic resilience and promoting social equity  and we reiterate the value in technical assistance  capacity building and practical cooperation in promoting development  We are committed to an effective  equitable  rules-based multilateral trading system  the freest possible flow of multilateral trade on terms fair and equitable to all  while taking into account the special requirements of small states and developing countries  

Cyberspace can help find synergies with other development work and thereby bring greater coherence to development initiatives  Through more universal access to information and to markets  Cyberspace can help remove disparities of opportunity and the means to bring these aspirations to fruition 

 
i Protecting the Environment

Our Charter says   We recognise the importance of the protection and conservation of our natural ecosystems and affirm that sustainable management of the natural environment is the key to sustained human development  We recognise the importance of multilateral cooperation  sustained commitment and collective action     The availability of previously unparalleled amounts of sensory information  through Cyberspace  helps us better manage our environment and can reveal to the public eye any emerging damage 

 
j Access to Health  Education  Food and Shelter

Our Charter says   We recognise the necessity of access to affordable health care  education  clean drinking water  sanitation and housing for all citizens and emphasise the importance of promoting health and well-being in combating communicable and non-communicable diseases   Access to information  reliable metrics and delivery channels offered by Cyberspace form a key part of delivering these outcomes  particularly for rural communities 

 
k Gender Equality

Our Charter says   We recognise that gender equality and women’s empowerment are essential components of human development and basic human rights  The advancement of women’s rights and the education of girls are critical preconditions for effective and sustainable development   Cyberspace can contribute significantly to promoting gender equality and equity  supporting Millennium 2015 Development Goal 3  though this depends upon access to ICT for women and girls  particularly in rural areas  Its nature as an open source of information and its ability to empower individuals  make Cyberspace a platform to promote gender equality 

 
l Importance of Young People in the Commonwealth

Our Charter says   We recognise the positive and active role and contributions of young people in promoting development  peace  democracy and in protecting and promoting other Commonwealth values  such as tolerance and understanding  including respect for other cultures     Young people  being digital natives  have embraced Cyberspace wholeheartedly and come up with numerous innovations that have enriched Cyberspace  Through education and guidance on the safe and effective use of Cyberspace  young people will channel this dynamism and creativity into higher purposes  fostering wider social understanding and triggering valuable innovation 

 
m Recognition of the Needs of Small States

Our Charter says   We are committed to assisting small and developing states in the Commonwealth  including the particular needs of small island developing states     Cyberspace could help small island states surmount numerous challenges including paucity of expertise  geographic isolation and economies of scale  Cyberspace offers a gateway to global markets for small scale producers as much as for large scale producers  breaking down one of the key barriers to market entry faced by small island states 

 
n Recognition of the Needs of Vulnerable States

Our Charter says   We are committed to collaborating to find ways to provide immediate help to the poorest and most vulnerable including least developed countries  and to develop responses to protect the people most at risk  Cyberspace could help poorest  most marginalised and vulnerable by providing access to information and to markets for economic development 

 
o The Role of Civil Society

Our Charter says   We recognise the important role that civil society plays in our communities and countries as partners in promoting and supporting Commonwealth values and principles     Cyberspace offers the means for easier and more effective engagement by individuals in society  particularly the rural  the vulnerable and marginalised  A more active civil society can help promote our values and principles in today’s Cyberspace  A more active civil society can also stimulate further progress in support of our values and principles by engaging directly in the development and operation of tomorrow’s Cyberspace 

 
p Cyberspace itself

Our Charter recognises the transformational role of Information and Communication Technology  which underpins Cyberspace  and the need to harness its power in a positive way   We also recognise the importance of information and communication technologies as powerful instruments of development; delivering savings  efficiencies and growth in our economies  as well as promoting education  learning and the sharing of culture  We are committed to strengthening its use while enhancing its security  for the purpose of advancing our societies  

SPANISH GOVERNMENT Contribution to the Global Multistakeholder
Meeting on the Future of Internet Governance
(São Paulo  23-24 April 2014)
Abstract
The Government of Spain appreciates the opportunity to participate in the  Global
Multi-stakeholder Meeting on the Future of Internet Governance   kindly hosted by
Brazil  We are very much looking forward to engaging with other stakeholders in open
discussions that pave the way for the evolution of the multistakeholder framework and
make it sustainable in the future  We wholeheartedly wish the meeting every success in
this important endeavour 
Internet Governance Principles
Internet Governance (IG) involves governments  technical community  private sector
and civil society in the development and application of a set of shared principles  rules 
decision making processes and programs that contribute to the development and use
of the Internet  This triple partake endows IG with its multistakeholder character 
Several sets of principles regarding the Internet have already been outlined by different
bodies and organizations worldwide  including the COMPACT principles put forward by
the EU Commission  It is not our goal here to number them in an exhaustive fashion 
but to underscore the ones particularly relevant for the forthcoming Brazil discussions 
Albeit acknowledging that principles should be long-lasting and respect technology
neutrality  while remaining ready to evolve in time  some of them constitute the core of
the framework and should not be subject to modification  the secure  open  free and
unfragmented nature of the Internet should remain  in full respect of human rights 
including freedom of expression 
Spain shares the view that private-sector led  bottom-up  multistakeholder model for
Internet governance  in particular for the technical coordination and management of the
domain name system  including the assurance of its resilience and stability  should be
continued and further developed  with a view to fostering innovation and progress 
Inclusiveness of all world regions in dialogues and decision making processes should
be further encouraged  Likewise  in furtherance of the MS model information sharing
and avenues for participation of Internet users not acquainted with the Internet
governing bodies  yet affected by their decisions  should be improved 
This multistakeholder framework should have as active ingredients true accountability
and transparency to be future-proof  This pair of ingredients makes up the crux of any
stakeholder organization since parties are governing themselves and must feel they
retain control over the policies adopted at it 
The same rights that people have in the analogue offline world must also be protected
in the digital online one  In this respect  while private sector initiative should be
maintained and innovation should not be hampered  the explosion of Internet and its
huge importance for people and businesses demands more involvement from
governments in the decision making processes that shape the Internet in order to
protect public policy interests 
In this light  sustaining the rule of law on the Internet has become a challenge given the
global nature of the network  Governments should work together to provide users with
affordable  swift and effective ways to assert their rights in a globalized marketplace 
Roadmap for the Further Evolution of the Internet Governance Ecosystem
Some suggestions regarding a roadmap for the development of the Internet
governance framework to be discussed in the Brazil conference follow 
1  Set up a scale line for the globalisation of ICANN and the Affirmation of
Commitments (AoC)
Spain supports an increase in the globalization of the IG framework and in particular of
ICANN's management of the DNS  The internationalisation of ICANN would facilitate
the involvement  on equal footing  of all interested authorities in its functioning 
supervision and decision making processes 
The major challenge for all stakeholders is to lay down the relevant procedures and
timescales for this process of internationalisation of ICANN  This could become a
discussion target for the Brazil conference 
2  Conduct an analysis aimed at globalising the IANA function
Regarding IANA’s function  all agents involved recognise it as critical  Therefore  Spain
agrees with the proposal of the European Commission to identify ways to globalise the
control over the IANA functions while safeguarding our shared interests in DNS stability
and security 
Any plan to globalize the IANA functions should be preceded by legal and technical
analysis to ensure that stability and security of the Internet are preserved in the
process of globalization of these functions 
In globalizing monitoring of IANA functions  prime importance should be attached to
setting a sound  stable and reliable supervisory system over the performance of the
IANA functions by ICANN 
3  Strengthen ICANN’s Governmental Advisory Committee (GAC)
Section I 2 11 of ICANN Bylaws states that in performing its mission  one of the core
values that should guide its decisions and actions is  while remaining rooted in the
private sector  recognizing that governments and public authorities are responsible for
public policy and duly taking into account governments' or public authorities'
recommendations  
The GAC has been given an explicit role to warrant the safeguarding of the public
interest  and hence it is crucial that it has the possibility to exercise their responsibilities
through a full involvement in ICANN’s decision making processes providing advice on
public policy matters  To this end  GAC recommendations should be reinforced  by
intensifying follow-ups on the coherence between Board measures and GAC
recommendations  and upgrading feedback mechanisms to help both parties
understand each other´s viewpoints and come to solutions congruous with public policy
interests 
Besides  the following proposals would heighten the multilateral character and the
efficiency of the GAC 
• Intensify the participation of States in the GAC  In this regard  the existing and
successful scholarship programme should be upheld and augmented 
• Enhance GAC working methods  procedures and decision making processes 
• Provide additional support to the GAC Secretariat to promote an agile working
environment that contributes to engaging more members in active discussions
and streamlining GAC involvement in ICANN policy development process 

    The representatives of Denmark would like to express our gratitude for the invitation to the Netmundial Global Multistakeholder Meeting on the Future of Internet Governance as well as for the opportunity to deliver our comments in preparation of the meeting  

    Denmark supports a single  free  unfragmented internet governed by a genuine multistakeholder model  The internet has served as an unparalleled promoter of economic growth and cross-border sharing of information  However  this will only continue if the internet is perceived as trustworthy and the protection of basic human rights  such as the right to privacy  seems to be a prerequisite to that 

     

    We believe that the point of departure for the development of a list of internet governance principles should be already existing texts such as the OECD's Principles for Internet Policy-making 

EUROPEAN COMMISSION
Directorate-General for Communications Networks  Content and Technology
NETMUNDIAL (SAO PAULO  23-24 APRIL 2014)
INPUT ON "INTERNET GOVERNANCE PRINCIPLES"
(This contribution is based on the Communication of the European Commission "Internet Policy and
Governance - Europe's role in Shaping the Future of the Internet"  COM(2014) 72/4  as well as a number of
discussions and positions on Internet governance  including inter alia the OECD Principles on Internet
Policy-making  and the G8 Deauville Declaration  This contribution is the sole responsibility of the
European Commission)
In preparation of the forthcoming Global Multistakeholder Meeting on the Future of
Internet Governance ("NETmundial") which will take place in Sao Paulo (Brazil) on
23-24 April 2014  this is one of two contributions of the European Commission to the
open call for contributions 
The first topic of the call for contributions is "Internet Governance Principles" 
"The NETmundial meeting aims to identify a set of universal principles to be promoted as
a global inspiration for the evolution of the Internet worldwide  Those principles should
be viewed from the perspective of the Internet as a platform for social  economic and
human development and a catalyzer to exercise human rights of all people of the world "
Following the conclusions of the 2002-2005 World Summit on the Information Society
(WSIS) 1 a number of organisations and groups came forward with various statements of
principles applying to substantive and/or procedural elements of Internet policies and
governance  In most cases  each of these statements was supported by a limited set of
stakeholders  or limited in geographical scope 2
The Commission is of the view that a process leading towards a more broadly supported
and coherent set of principles for Internet governance would be helpful in finding
common ground at the global level 
Such a coherent set of principles should serve as an agreed  high-level guidance to
identify the priorities  constraints and objectives of policy and operational activities
related to the future of the Internet and of its governance  Accordingly  such principles
should feed into the concrete roadmap for the further evolution of the Internet
governance ecosystem  both from a procedural / institutional and from a substantive point
1 See http //www itu int/wsis 
2 Examples include the OECD Principles on Internet Policy-Making and the 2011 G8 Deauville
Declaration  The organisers of NETmundial have helpfully collected a broad range of Internet
governance principles at http //content netmundial br/internet-governance-principles/  An analysis of a
broad number of Internet principles  mostly related to "Internet freedom"  is available at
http //bestbits net/issue-comparison-of-major-declarations-on-internet-freedom/

of view  The Commission is providing its views on the possible elements of a roadmap
separately 
For over two years  the Commission has advocated an approach summarised by the
COMPACT acronym 3 the Internet as a space of Civic responsibilities  One
unfragmented resource governed via a Multistakeholder approach to Promote democracy
and Human Rights  based on a sound technological Architecture that engenders
Confidence and facilitates a Transparent governance both of the underlying Internet
infrastructure and of the services which run on top of it 
More concretely  the Internet COMPACT is based on the following core beliefs 
1  The Internet is an ecosystem in which every participant must take up its
social responsibilities  Having due regard to applicable legislation concerning
the responsibilities of Internet intermediaries  in order to ensure the sustainability
of the Internet from both a technological and a societal point of view it is
necessary for the global community to work together towards a common
understanding both of corporate social responsibility across the whole Internet
value-chain and of the appropriate approaches to self- and co-regulation on the
Internet  as a complement to regulation – which should always remain as an
option but be used carefully and mindful of possible negative effects on
innovation  In any case  it is essential to ensure that fundamental rights are duly
respected and enforced 
2  The Internet should remain one single unfragmented space  where all
resources should be accessible in the same manner  irrespective of the
location of the user and the provider  Even when faced with complex
regulatory or political challenges  filtering traffic at borders or other purely
national approaches can lead to fragmentation of the Internet and could
compromise economic growth and the free flow of information  This does not
exclude increased efforts towards diversification of the underlying infrastructure
such as local internet exchange points and transmission capacity  which can
strengthen the resilience and robustness of the Internet  as well as measures
necessary to protect fundamental rights and to address concerns raised by
revelations of large-scale surveillance and intelligence activities 
3  Internet-related discussions and decisions should be based on a strengthened 
genuine multi-stakeholder model  This implies that the necessary intergovernmental
discussions are anchored in a multistakeholder context in the full
understanding that the Internet is built and maintained by a variety of
stakeholders  as well as governments  Furthermore  all decisions should be taken
on the basis of principles of good governance  including transparency 
accountability  and inclusiveness of all relevant stakeholders  Appropriate efforts
should be made in order to counter the significant differences in the ability to
participate across the various stakeholder groups to better ensure
representativeness  Furthermore  it should be recognised that different stages of
decision making processes each have their own requirements and may involve
different sets of stakeholders  A sustainable model needs to clearly define the
roles of actors in the governance process  including the role of public authorities
to fulfil their public policy responsibilities consistent with human rights online 
For the sake of clarity  this does not necessarily imply that the role of public
3 First presented at the occasion of the OECD's High-Level Meeting on the Internet Economy 
28 06 2011  http //ec europa eu/commission_2010-2014/kroes/en/blog/i-propose-a-compact-for-theinternet 
3
authorities should be strengthened; on the contrary  it is quite possible that in
certain well-defined cases the role of public authorities should be limited 
4  The Internet should be a space subject to the same laws and norms that
apply in other areas of our day-to-day lives; and where individuals can
benefit from their rights  and from judicial remedies when those rights are
infringed  An open and free Internet in which all rights and freedoms that people
have offline also apply online facilitates social and democratic progress
worldwide  Some states  quoting security concerns  attempt to curb global
connectivity of their citizens by censorship and other restrictions  This is not
acceptable  Blocking  slowing down or discrimination of content  applications
and services goes against the open nature of the Internet4 
5  The technical architecture of the Internet should be able to evolve to cope
with new and often unforeseen challenges  This ability  which is based inter
alia on the open and distributed nature of the Internet  based on non-proprietary
standards which create low barriers of entry  should be preserved  At the same
time  research  innovation and experimentation  both in the core and at the edges
of the Internet  should be promoted  Furthermore  Technical details of Internet
protocols and other information technology specifications can have significant
public policy implications  Their design can impact on human rights such as
users' data protection rights and security  their ability to access diverse knowledge
and information  and their freedom of expression online  It also affects other
stakeholders  including companies conducting business online  An effective
multistakeholder approach to specification setting on the internet will be based on
efficient mutual interactions between technical and public policy considerations5
so that technical specifications more systematically take into account public
policy concerns  This is particularly important when legal rights of individuals 
especially their human rights  are clearly impacted 
6  Confidence in the Internet and its governance is a prerequisite for the
realisation of the Internet's potential as an engine for economic growth and
innovation  A rising number of activities online directly contravene the exercise
of fundamental rights  Cybercrime  including online child abuse  identity theft 
cyber-attacks and non-cash payment fraud  and other forms of unlawful
processing of personal data pose a serious threat to confidence in the use of the
Internet  Large-scale surveillance and intelligence activities have also led to a loss
of confidence in the Internet and its present governance arrangements  All these
challenges need to be addressed urgently  with the full involvement of all
stakeholders  The role of the technical community is crucial  including by
ensuring confidence in IP based communications and the resilience of
cryptosystems to increase the trustworthiness of IP-based communications  This
would support an effective fight against cyber-crime and ensure the privacy of
users 
7  Transparent  inclusive  balanced and accountable governance of the Internet
(concerning both its infrastructure and the activities which take place on top
of it) is paramount for the sustainability of the Internet as a single

measures concerning the European single market for electronic communications and to achieve a

unfragmented resource  Sound multistakeholder processes remain essential for
the future governance of the Internet  However  the fact that a process is claimed
to be "multi-stakeholder" does not per se guarantee outcomes that are widely seen
to be legitimate  Multistakeholder processes in relation to Internet policies must
fulfil  beyond their consistency with fundamental rights  at least the following
requirements  (a) transparency; (b) inclusiveness and balance; (c) accountability 
Furthermore  the ability of public authorities that derive their powers and
legitimacy from democratic processes to fulfil their public policy responsibilities
- where those are compatible with universal human rights - should be ensured 
This includes their right to intervene with regulation where required 
The Commission sees the Internet COMPACT as the guiding principles that will guide
its efforts towards an Internet that should remain a single  open  free  unfragmented
network of networks  subject to the same laws and norms that apply in other areas of our
day-to-day lives  Its governance should be based on an inclusive  transparent and
accountable multistakeholder model of governance  without prejudice to any regulatory
intervention that may be taken in view of identified public interest objectives such as to
ensure the respect for human rights  fundamental freedoms and democratic values as
well as linguistic and cultural diversity and care for vulnerable persons  A safe 
secure  sound and resilient architecture is the basis for trust and confidence of
Internet users  At the same time  the innovation power of the Internet must be
maintained  This requires careful yet robust stewardship

INPUT ON "ROADMAP FOR THE FURTHER EVOLUTION
OF THE INTERNET GOVERNANCE ECOSYSTEM"
(This contribution is based on the Communication of the European Commission "Internet Policy and
Governance - Europe's role in Shaping the Future of the Internet"  COM(2014) 72/4  as well as a number of
discussions and positions on Internet governance  including inter alia the OECD Principles on Internet
Policy-making  and the G8 Deauville Declaration  This contribution is the sole responsibility of the
European Commission )
In preparation of the forthcoming Global Multistakeholder Meeting on the Future of
Internet Governance ("NETmundial") which will take place in Sao Paulo (Brazil) on
23-24 April 2014  this is the second of two contributions of the European Commission in
response to the open call for contributions 
The second topic of the call for contributions is "Roadmap for the Further Evolution of
the Internet Governance Ecosystem" 
"There is a broad view about the need to continue evolving the Multistakeholder Internet
Governance Ecosystem  The goals are to energize discussion and to achieve greater
consensus of the community including a broader range of stakeholders to provide
possible means for developing solutions to specific problems faced by
governments/stakeholders  There are several ongoing initiatives trying to contribute with
that objective  The meeting and related discussions will be an important milestone to
support the developing multistakeholder consensus on important governance issues  It
could serve as valuable inputs to other forums  seek for more clarification and pursue
agreements for the way forward "
The working definition of "Internet governance" 1 agreed as part of the conclusions of the
2002-2005 World Summit on the Information Society (WSIS) 2 was carefully designed 
following extensive multi-stakeholder discussions within the ad hoc Working Group on
Internet Governance 3 as a dynamic concept that could be adapted to the evolving
challenges and opportunities of a growing Internet 
1 WSIS Tunis Agenda  paragraph 34  "A working definition of Internet governance is the development
and application by governments  the private sector and civil society  in their respective roles  of
shared principles  norms  rules  decision-making procedures  and programmes that shape the
evolution and use of the Internet" 
2 See http //www itu int/wsis 
3 See http //www wgig org/About html

Indeed  a number of parallel discussions and conversations on the possible evolution and
future of global Internet governance frameworks are taking place throughout the world 
Although such variety of discussions can be beneficial in ensuring that a diversity of
viewpoints can contribute to the reflection  there is a clear risk that a multiplicity of fora
may lead to duplication of efforts and  most importantly  to the exclusion and
disenfranchisement of persons and organisations with less resources  This is precisely the
opposite of what should happen if we want the future of the global Internet and of its
governance to be seen as truly legitimate 
Therefore  the European Commission welcomes the objective of NETmundial to act as a
catalyser in finding commonalities and a shared understanding of the most important
steps in front of us  The most useful result of the NETmundial meeting would be for the
Internet community to clearly identify risks and opportunities as well as work-streams 
relevant actors and corresponding mandates for action  NETmundial should be seen as an
essential milestone in the context of the several discussions and processes that are taking
place  including within the UN Working Group on Enhanced Cooperation  the WSIS+10
review  the Internet Governance Forum process and the 2014 ITU Plenipotentiary
conference 
In this spirit  the European Commission would like to offer a number of concrete and
operational suggestions towards a shared roadmap for the evolution of the Internet
governance ecosystem  These concrete suggestions are based on the core principles that
guide the activities of the Commission when it comes to Internet – the Internet
COMPACT  which has been outlined in the separate submission on "Internet principles" 
1  In order to further strengthen the multi-stakeholder model  operational guidelines
should be developed  based on an exchange of best practice  in order to ensure
that multi-stakeholder processes in relation to Internet policies fulfil – beyond
their consistency with fundamental rights – at least the following requirements 
a  Transparency  All stakeholders must have meaningful access to and
information on the organisational processes and procedures under which
the body operates  This should prevent in particular any proxy activity for
silent stakeholders 
b  Inclusiveness and Balance  Those responsible for an inclusive process
must make a reasonable effort to reach out to all parties impacted by a
given topic  and offer fair and affordable opportunities to participate and
contribute to all key stages of decision making  while avoiding capture of
the process by any dominant stakeholder or vested interests 
c  Accountability  There should be clear  public commitments to give
regular account to its stakeholders or independent supervisory bodies  and
to allow any party to seek redress through effective dispute resolution
mechanisms 
Appropriate leeway should be left to each relevant organisation  process or forum
to identify the most suitable way to decline the general approach to their specific
challenges and constraints  in a spirit of subsidiarity 4
As part of this reflection  it is essential to come to a shared understanding and

role of public authorities to fulfil their public policy responsibilities consistent
with human rights online  The European Commission is ready to work with other
stakeholders in order to develop such guidelines 
2  Stronger interactions between stakeholders involved in Internet governance
should be fostered via issue-based dialogues  instead of through new bodies 
This would allow relevant stakeholders to address specific challenges across
structural and organisational boundaries  Often  similar discussions on Internetrelated
policies take place across these different organisations  with a
considerable overlap of people and topics  This leads both to a "silo" mentality
and to a "discussion fatigue"  In addition  this tends to exclude people and groups
which do not have the necessary resources (in terms of time  knowledge 
funding) to follow all of them 
A different "cross-cutting" approach  through which the focus is on the
specific topic of discussion (e g  privacy  security  consumer protection  human
rights) rather than on the organisation / forum which is assumed to be the "right"
place to hold that discussion  should be sought  Appropriate supporting tools
should be developed  allowing interested parties to be involved on specific topics
discussed in multiple fora at the same time 
The European Commission is launching the technical development of the
Global Internet Policy Observatory (GIPO) in 2014 as one such tool and as a
resource for the global community;5 the Commission further welcomes the
cooperation of all interested parties in this initiative 
3  The Internet has become a key infrastructure with global dimensions  It works
well without structural oversight by international intergovernmental bodies  At
the same time  greater international balance within the existing structures can
increase the legitimacy of current governance arrangements 
Accordingly  concrete and actionable steps  including a clear timeline  should
be identified in order to 
a  Globalise the IANA functions  whilst safeguarding the continued
stability and security of the domain name system 
b  Globalise ICANN  including its Affirmation of Commitments 
In carrying this out  the continued stability and security of the Domain Name
System shall be safeguarded 
The European Commission is optimistic  given the positive signals from leading
national actors  that a shared vision to achieve the above goals can be validated at
the NETmundial meeting  The Commission believes that although all
stakeholders  including governments and public authorities  should contribute to
the debate in all relevant fora  the natural place to take these action forward from
an operational point of view would be ICANN itself and the communities
working within and with ICANN 
4  Mutually respectful dialogues between all stakeholders on the future development
of global Internet governance are essential given the global economic and
societal importance of the Internet  The Internet Governance Forum (IGF) has
emerged from the World Summit on Information Society (WSIS) to facilitate
5 See http //ec europa eu/digital-agenda/en/news/commission-plans-guide-through-global-internetpolicy-
labyrinth 
4
forward-looking discussions amongst all stakeholders  many of whom had not
cooperated closely before  It is important  however  to improve the quality and
format of IGF outcomes to enhance its impact on global Internet governance and
policy  The European Commission is confident that a strengthened IGF will
progressively become an important driver of successful Internet governance;
however  these necessary improvements should not be a reason to delay other
urgently needed activities 
Accordingly  the IGF should be strengthened  taking account of the
Recommendations of the Working Group on Improvements to the IGF 6 The
Commission is already a key financial contributor to the IGF Secretariat and to
the general activities of the IGF  and stands ready to cooperate with all other
stakeholders to strengthen the IGF along the above-mentioned lines 
5  Technical details of Internet protocols and other information technology
specifications can have significant public policy implications  Even where the
technical discussion process is open  key decisions are frequently made by
technical experts in the absence of broad stakeholder representation  An effective
multistakeholder approach to specification setting on the internet will be based
on efficient mutual interactions between technical and public policy
considerations7 so that technical specifications more systematically take into
account public policy concerns  This is particularly important when legal rights
of individuals  especially their human rights  are clearly impacted  The
implications of this evolution in norm setting in relation to the Internet require an
open public debate with all concerned 
The Commission proposes to convene  together with interested parties  a series
of workshops with international experts in law  ethics8  social sciences 
economics  international relations and technology  in order to develop concrete
and actionable recommendations to ensure coherence between existing
normative frameworks and new forms of Internet-enabled norm-setting 
Furthermore  all stakeholders should strengthen (and where appropriate create)
structured mechanisms to allow regular  early and truly inclusive upstream
participation  review and comment in technical decisions  These structured
mechanisms should also strive towards consistency of technical decisions with
human rights  The Commission stands ready to discuss with relevant
stakeholders the best options to achieve this objective 
6  Like other cross-border activities  the Internet poses a series of challenges for the
application of laws  While such challenges are not always specific to the Internet 
the sheer quantity of cross-border transactions of various types which take place
online  call for a more thorough reflection on how existing rules apply on the
Internet  Furthermore  many activities on the Internet are increasingly governed
by contractual arrangements between private companies and users on the
Internet  Non-contractual obligations of e-commerce traders and intermediaries
are also relevant in this context  The complexity and  in some cases  the
opaqueness of these arrangements  including for what concerns provisions on

applicable jurisdiction and law  may give rise to a certain degree of legal
uncertainty 
The European Commission plans to launch an in-depth review of the risks  at
international level  of conflicts of laws and jurisdictions arising on the
Internet and assess all mechanisms  processes and tools available and
necessary to solve such conflicts  Cooperation with existing or planned
initiatives would help identifying globally shared solutions in the mid- to longterm 
The Commission sees the above steps as key elements of a concrete roadmap for the
evolution of the Internet governance ecosystem  For the European Commission  the end
goal is an Internet that should remain a single  open  free  unfragmented network of
networks  subject to the same laws and norms that apply in other areas of our day-to-day
lives  Its governance should be based on an inclusive  transparent and accountable
multistakeholder model of governance  without prejudice to any regulatory intervention
that may be taken in view of identified public interest objectives such as to ensure the
respect for human rights  fundamental freedoms and democratic values as well as
linguistic and cultural diversity and care for vulnerable persons  A safe  secure 
sound and resilient architecture is the basis for trust and confidence of Internet users 
At the same time  the innovation power of the Internet must be maintained  This
requires careful yet robust stewardship 

Switzerland’s contribution to the NETmundial conference

Switzerland welcomes and supports the intention of the  Global Multi-stakeholder Meeting on the Future of Internet governance  in Sao Paolo  Brazil  to discuss global Internet governance principles and the roadmap for the further evolution of the Internet governance ecosystem  We look forward to taking part in valuable and constructive discussions with all other stakeholders  Switzerland would like to take the opportunity prior to this meeting to submit its views on both main themes of the conference 
Switzerland’s role in the Internet governance debate

Since the beginning of the Internet governance debate at the WSIS in Geneva  Switzerland has played an active role in shaping the Internet governance process  for instance in facilitating the consensus at the WSIS  leading the UN Working Group on Internet governance (WGIG)  being a key supporter of the IGF and also supporting constructive discussions at the CSTD  in ICANN  etc  Ever since  Switzerland has stood for and defended principles such as inclusiveness and democratic participation  transparency and accountability in Internet governance  Switzerland has contributed to the ongoing debate not least due to its long-lasting experience in consensus-finding and policy-making in a multicultural and multilinguistic environment  Because of its participatory and decentralized direct-democratic governance system  Switzerland envisages rules of the games designed to make the Internet open  inclusive  interoperable  reliable and secure 

Switzerland has taken actively part in the global Internet governance debate and will continue to do so  For that purpose  Switzerland is committed to foster an approach that allows all stakeholders  in their respective roles  to shape the discussion and decision-making on an equal footing  Not only will Switzerland hold on to the multistakeholder approach  but also invigorate it   
Section 1  Internet governance principles
1 1 Underlying principles

Transparency

It is crucial that we endorse transparency by enabling access to the information relevant for a decision  Thus  procedural transparency  decision-making transparency as well as substantive transparency are tenets Switzerland is holding on to 

Accountability

It is paramount that each actor  in its respective role assumes responsibility for actions  products  decisions and policies 

Participation

The public value of the Internet is key  as it affects all aspects of our daily lives  be it in the professional or private field  Therefore  public involvement as well as public scrutiny allows for public intervention in decision-making processes 

Human Rights

It is pivotal that we develop a globally shared set of fundamental principles for the virtual space which are based on globally shared fundamental values of human rights and fundamental freedoms that apply equally to all the people in the world – online as well as offline  The Resolution „the right to privacy in the digital age  supported by Switzerland underscores the need to protect as well as to promote human rights in the digital era 

 
1 2 Vehicle for implementing globally shared Internet governance principles  Multistakeholder approach

We need to develop Internet governance principles that enable everybody to participate on an equal footing in setting the rules for the internet  We want everybody to be able to act as freely as possible in the internet  with as few restrictions as possible  But this means that we all need to act responsibly and to respect the freedoms and rights of the others  too  All stakeholders from all around the world should be able to participate in the development of such principles and should also participate in their implementation  The implementation of any such principles will only work if all stakeholders are included in the process of their development and thus take ownership of these principles and thus are committed to implementing them subsequently 
1 3 Existing Internet governance principles

In the past few years  a significant number of Internet governance principles have been developed in different fora and by different stakeholders both at the global and regional level  Some of them have been developed in thorough and inclusive multistakeholder processes  In particular  we would like to highlight the 10 Internet governance principles of the Council of Europe (https //wcd coe int/ViewDoc jsp?id=1835773) and the Charter of the Internet Rights and principles (http //internetrightsandprinciples org/site/charter/)  These are drafted very coherently  based on existing fundamental rights and principles and have a broad support from all stakeholders involved  Furthermore  we would like to refer to the OECD Council recommendation on principles for internet policy making (http //www oecd org/sti/ieconomy/49258588 pdf)  as they are based on a more economic approach and have also been widely consulted with many stakeholders (noting however that some civil society stakeholders did not fully agree with all of these principles)  There are also examples of Internet governance principles elaborated in inclusive processes at national level  such as in particular the Brazilian Internet Steering Committee’s principles for the governance and use of the Internet (http //www cgi br/regulamentacao/pdf/resolucao-2009-003-pt-en-es pdf) which can also serve as a valuable input to the discussion on globally shared principles 
1 4 The way forward

These and other already existing documents might serve as a basis of our future efforts as they provide an excellent starting point for our way forward  Rather than repeating or summarizing here the points made in these various documents  Switzerland would like to emphasize the fundamental importance of an inclusive bottom-up process for the development of globally shared principles  Since 2011  the UN Internet governance Forum (IGF) has undertaken efforts in discussing existing principles and working towards a globally shared set of principles  As different stakeholders from all around the world may have different views on fundamental issues and a consensus on a binding agreement may only emerge gradually  we proposes to be inspired by the concept of   rough consensus  

In order to develop a set of global principles which can and actually will be implemented by all stakeholders  it is important that it is important that we get a clearer understanding and acceptance of the respective roles of all stakeholders in Internet governance  § 35 of the Tunis Agenda  which describes the roles of all stakeholders unilaterally from a governments’ point of view in 2005  is a useful start to a more detailed discussion about these respective roles  Since 2005  the virtual world has evolved and the post-WSIS challenges have become clearer  The roles of stakeholders have developed differently in the various issues  We are therefore convinced that  in order to come up with meaningful results  we need to look at and discuss the roles of stakeholders concretely depending on the issues at stake 

There are issues  like for instance the fight against cybercrime or the protection of rule of law and fundamental rights  where governments have significant responsibilities  At the same time  the other stakeholders have roles in these issues  too  Elsewhere  such as the management and allocation of infrastructure and resources  there is more space for letting market forces rule  All stakeholders  particularly those that have a leading role from time to time  should act transparently and should be accountable not just to themselves  but to the general public in whose interest they are to act 

In addition  Switzerland believes that we also have to make a distinction between issues where we need to have binding agreements and others where a more flexible and non-binding common understanding might be more effective in serving the public interest 

 
Section 2  Roadmap for the Further Evolution of the Internet governance Ecosystem
2 1 Scope of Internet governance

According to the working definition for Internet governance as agreed in §34 of the Tunis Agenda  internet governance comprises a very broad and diverse range of standard setting and decision making processes that include all stakeholders in their respective roles   A working definition of Internet governance is the development and application by governments  the private sector and civil society  in their respective roles  of shared principles  norms  rules  decision-making procedures  and programs that shape the evolution and use of the Internet  

Consequently  the issues that are part of Internet governance are not only issues about infrastructure or critical internet resources  but also a very wide range of public policy issues related to the use and development of the Internet by all stakeholders and the impacts of this on the daily lives of us all 
2 2 Public policy issues

While the architecture  functioning and interplay of the different elements of the Internet is complex and diverse  the range of public policy issues related to its use and development is even more so 

This diversity is also reflected in the current Internet governance ecosystem  In the past decades  as the internet has grown in its importance for the economic  social  political and cultural aspects of our daily lives  many institutions and processes traditionally dealing with a wide range of public policy issues in the offline world have become part of the Internet governance ecosystem  but with very diverse traditions  histories and cultures   Traditional  Internet governance institutions and processes which have been dealing with what they themselves perceived as mainly  technical  issues  are now being looked at differently by the general public  as it is perceived that so called  technical  issues may have effects on our economic  political  social or cultural lives 

The complexity of the Internet and its governance ecosystem has grown to an extent that makes it difficult for many stakeholders  in particular those not very familiar with the details of it  to find their way and to identify which aspect of Internet governance is dealt with by whom and where and how these elements play together 
2 3 Commonalities

In light of the above  Switzerland welcomes the opportunity provided by the NETmundial conference to discuss a roadmap for the further evolution of the Internet governance ecosystem with all stakeholders on a global level  This should  in our view  help all stakeholders worldwide to better understand the issues as well as the functions of the current ecosystem  The aim is to identify in what direction this ecosystem should evolve in order to make it easier for all stakeholders to actively participate in the discussion and decision-making on public policy issues related to the Internet 

In our view  given this diversity and complexity of issues  there is no one-size-fits-all solution of a governance model for all elements of Internet governance  Depending on the concrete issues dealt with  the processes for dialogue and decision-making will have to be different  Also  the roles of stakeholders involved will differ  depending on the concrete issues 

Nonetheless  we believe that it is possible to develop a number of common features that are necessary for all such governance processes in order to make sure that they are able to produce an outcome which is in the global public interest  It is of the essence to respond to the different needs and circumstances of the people using the Internet in different parts of the world  living in different economic  cultural and political environments 

Such common features of all Internet governance processes could be 

    Inclusion at the global level of all stakeholders in their respective roles  including a commonly shared understanding of these roles and the responsibilities that go along with them
    Participatory bottom-up processes in decision-making
    Accountability and transparency of the decision-making processes to the general public
    Checks and balances in order to make sure that decisions can be evaluated and modified if necessary with a view to act in the global public interest(s)
    Building on principles of the rule of law and agreed fundamental rights and freedoms
    Building on a decentralized system of the Internet as well as its governance which should allow for an adequate diversity in applying agreed common principles  while respecting interoperability  universality and reliance and allowing further evolution of the technical infrastructure as well as of its governance models 

It is our understanding that any decision taken by those in power can be challenged by those affected and that minorities and weaker parties need to be protected from abuse of power  We believe in competition of ideas and in economic competition  At the same time  based on our experience  we believe that there should be a certain level of solidarity and equality of access to opportunities  We are convinced that these values can also be useful for developing a commonly shared set of global Internet governance principles on a global level and for the further evolution of the Internet governance ecosystem which should allow all people in the world to responsibly exercise their fundamental rights and freedoms online as well as offline 
Conclusion

Switzerland encourages further multi-stakeholder discussions to clarify and to clearly recognize each others’ roles and responsibilities in a multi-stakeholder process  We should further identify and discuss shortcomings of the present situation and discuss possible solutions for an appropriate implementation of a true multi-stakeholder approach to Internet governance  In order to enable a balanced discussion between a variety of people with different cultures  different visions and different needs  the process used for developing Internet governance principles and for further developing the Internet governance ecosystem should be bottom-up and respectful of diversity  while respecting existing fundamental rights and freedoms  Checks and balances are pivotal for all groups of people and interests to feel represented in such a process  to accept its outcome and to constructively contribute to its implementation 

We are committed to contributing to such a process with our experience and ideas  

Principles of Internet Governance

1     Full respect for human rights 

2     Respect for freedom of expression 

3     Respect for the privacy of individuals and the protection of personal data  avoiding surveillance and collection of personal data in an arbitrarily way and / or contrary to the law  avoiding also supervision by corporations or governments that do not comply with due process 

4     Respect the rights of consumers and users  promoting a comprehensive framework to enhance consumer protection online 

5     Internet governance should be based on democratic and multistakeholder processes  where all stakeholders have relevant representation and their views can be taken in consideration  with special attention given to the role of governments  and the need to increase their participation in decision-making processes and in the debates and discussions 

6      Promote greater transparency in Internet governance 

7     Promote an information society based on knowledge sharing  preserving the security  stability and continuity of the Internet 

8     Promote the right to Internet as a techno-cultural tool to enhance personal and social development at the national  regional and global level 

9     Promote fair and equitable universal access for all  with special emphasis on vulnerable people  girls and women  seniors and people with special needs 

10   Respect the culture and language diversity  where the Internet should be the platform for creating and sharing content in the preferred language 

11   Promote the development of a neutral network  avoiding filtering and traffic restrictions 

12   Promote a responsible use of the Internet  based on education and awareness for the prevention of vulnerabilities and attacks 

13   Promote balanced geographic representation of all regions in organizations of the ecosystem of Internet Governance  where special attention must be given to gender balance 

 

14   Promote cooperation to improve the collection and dissemination of information related to security  promoting also the exchange good practices among all stakeholders 

Argentina and Internet Governance

Argentina is actively involved in all areas of debate and participation in Internet Governance  ICANN  IGF  Regional IGF regional  regional meetings of the Latin America and Caribbean Information Society Plan of Action  eLAC  among others  

Argentina believes that a new development of the ecosystem of Internet Governance should be achieved through the strengthening of existing structures based on the multi-stakeholder model where all stakeholders are equally represented  including governments  from all the regions and considering gender balance 

Argentina supports the multi-stakeholder model for the Internet governance and recognizes the value of involving all stakeholders  with special attention given to their respective roles 

Argentina recognizes that Internet governance is more than the allocation of domain names and IP addresses  It includes also aspects of public policy  as expressed in paragraph 58 of the Tunis Agenda adopted by WSIS  highlighting that the responsibility of the definition of these policies rests within the States and this is an inalienable right 

Therefore  it is understood that the current ecosystem of Internet governance must evolve towards a more balanced model that guarantees the participation of all parties on an equal footing  in particular the least developed countries  taking into consideration the current and future Internet 

In this scenario  governements play a critical role in Internetr governance and efforts must be made to increase their participation in the decision-making processes and in the debates and discussions 

Argentina recognizes the need for a greater cooperation  to enable governments  on an equal footing  play their role and responsibilities in international public policy issues pertaining to the Internet 

 

Roadmap for the future development of the Internet Governance ecosystem

Strengthen the organizations of the Internet ecosystem (I * Organizations) through increasing the participation of all relevant stakeholders from all regions  including governments and taking into account gender balance 

In particular  the following recommendations are made 

 

On the Internationalization of ICANN 

Promote the internationalization of ICANN  through a deep revision of the current structure 

Achieve relevant and active representation from all regions and all actors in the ICANN structure  including representatives of governments on an equal footing  taking into account gender balance  These principles should be specially considered in the following Advisor Commitees and Supporting Organizations 

• The ICANN board

• The Security and Stability Advisor Committee (SSAC)

• The Generic Names Supporting Organization (GNSO)

 

Governmental Advisory Committee GAC  

 Promote the participation of as many countries as possible  especially developing countries 

Promote the rotation of all the regions in the GAC chair and vice roles  creating five permanent vice-chairs  one from each region  elected by consensus  within each region 

 Take in consideration the suggested changes made by the GAC restructuring working group specially formed  led by Spain where Argentina has participated 

 

IANA-  RIRs - ISOC – IETF

Strengthen the structure of IANA and the RIRs through the relevant participation of representatives of all stakeholders including representatives of governments  universities  civil society and private sector  who should be all involved in the decision making process related to related to critical Internet resources 

Promote relevant and ongoing participation of experts of all regions in decision-making spaces of the Internet Society and the Internet Engineering Task Force 

There is sufficient experience and trained professionals in all regions of the world  even in countries with a lower degree of relative development  to be considered as suitable candidates for general participation and for leadership positions in these organizations  including board of directors 

There should be gender balance in the board of directors and leadership positions in these organizations  there are enough women professionals perfectly able to be considered as good candidates for these positions 

 

Internet Governance Forum 

Strengthen the Internet Governance Forum (IGF)  as the main global forum where Internet Governance is debated  where all stakeholders participate on an equal footing  

Strenghthen the mechanisms to promote the participation of all stakeholders from developing countries in the Internet Governance Forum (IGF) 

The articulation of a succinct global development agenda leveraging Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) at the turn of the new century proved valuable for the discussions among Small Island Development States (SIDS) on addressing vulnerability  Although implicitly  the traditional focus among associations comprising such constituents often excluded new areas and actors in external policy with some reason  It is worth reiterating that both phases of the World Summit on the Information Society (WSIS) underscore the promise that the Information Society holds for the sustainable development of countries  and make mention of special attention to be paid to the particular needs of the citizens of developing countries including SIDS 

The multi-stakeholder governance model founded on clear rules and principles is undoubtedly the key to maintaining a free and open Internet through which all people are free to express  create  communicate and innovate and  more specifically  enjoy the human rights  fundamental freedoms and democratic values that are guaranteed to them by the Universal Charter on Human Rights  To this end  the policy authority of the State is recognised and required to ensure that balance is afforded to all of its citizens using the Internet  The foundation of Internet economies  and the prosperity of economic constituents are also of vital interest to the State  given that SIDS are susceptible to becoming more vulnerable as a consequence of globalisation and increasingly liberalised trade 

Nonetheless  real challenges and complexities arise for small-country actors which are related to the existing multi-stakeholder process for Internet Governance where there is an acute dearth of capacity for the engagement of both state and non-state actors in said process  This results in low or no participation in diverse and sometimes fragmented fora regardless of their decision-making or shaping nature  Non-state actors are particularly challenged from the perspective of influence  In this context  a hybrid situation occurs where despite the existence of strong democratic tradition and practice  governments in SIDS  where appropriate  take the lead on various external engagements that  in turn  benefit all actors 

 

A two-fold dilemma arises where firstly  access achievements are incongruous to wider ICT/Information Society achievements (for which the State is attributable) because of a real organisational shortcoming within governments to address the diverse set of domestic public policy interests that are attendant to infrastructural development  These interests span across the areas of cybercrime  data protection/privacy  and intellectual property to name a few  and even touch upon traditional aspects of economic policy such as competitiveness and innovation  Secondly  the public policy process becomes distorted in that exogenous agents drive its development as opposed to internal conditions 

ICTs have been particularly useful in partially addressing the capacity challenge where training is increasingly being offered through distance learning to sensitise policy makers on the scope and nature of challenges within Internet Governance debates  These efforts appear somewhat disconnected to the diverse spaces through which public policy is addressed  For instance  the venue’s distance from capital  duration and sometimes duplicative agendas of meetings put a considerable strain on the already limited resources of SIDS  While remote participation is also acknowledged as a tool for solving this matter  it may be inconsistent across fora and sometimes underdeveloped because of its dependencies and inherent shortcomings in facilitating meaningful participation and exchanges from small-country actors 

In light of the foregoing  there is a call for consideration and meaningful action to be made for developing countries including SIDS  which must be included in future formulae for multi-stakeholder governance

Content submission by the Federal Government of Mexico
We are convinced Internet is a powerful means through which nations can reach targets of social and economic development  As stated in Mexico’s National Digital Strategy presented by the President of Mexico  Enrique Peña Nieto  empirical evidence has shown that the adoption of ICT positively impacts GDP growth  job creation  productivity  innovation  quality of life of the population  equality  transparency and efficiency in the provision of utilities  The global adoption of mobile telephony and the rapid growth of broadband  have promoted the flow of ideas and goods in a global environment  ICT changed the way people reportedly communicates sports  do business  work and study  and therefore have become the element that has contributed to the development of societies that have managed to incorporate and use them in their activities every day  This has been reflected in the recent telecommunication´s amendment approved by the Mexican Congress  where establish that  the State shall guarantee the right of access to ICT  as well as broadcasting and telecommunications access including broadband and Internet access  for all Mexican citizens 
In this sense  we appreciate the effort and initiative of the Brazilian Federal Government to organize the  Global Multistakeholder Meeting on the Future of the Internet Governance  taking into account that digital natives are increasing around the world where an improved environment of the Internet ecosystem is required  We emphasize the importance of maintaining a multi-stakeholder model of decision making when it comes to internet governance  as we recognize that the entire Internet community must continue working together if we want the Internet to remain an open  vibrant platform for innovation  growth  and the free exchange of ideas  and if we want to expand the reach of this technology to those who remain unconnected 
Considering the context of the topics that are being discussed during the meeting  we submit the following contribution 
Internet Governance Principles
The Mexican Government has participated in numerous international fora in which the principles related to the Information Society and the Internet has been main subjects  Furthermore we consider that many of these principles are currently in force and some new elements could be added to them 
In general  the Mexican Government is looking to keep the main concepts that are contained in our national legal and policy framework  as well as international treaties of which Mexico is a signatory 
1  Wide protection of Human Rights in the digital era
2  Non-discriminatory and inclusive access to the Internet
3  Guarantee the right of access to public information  open data and freedom expression as well as the right for data protection and privacy
4  Promote effective competition in telecommunications and ICT services and promote anti-trust policies and regulations 
5  Strengthen the integration to the Information Society to guarantee equal access to information  education and opportunities for the digital world
6  Consider telecommunications  including broadband and Internet  as a worldwide public service of
general interest 
7  Social responsibility of the public  social and private sectors in favor of using Internet for
economic and social development 
8  Multi-stakeholder participation according to the procedures of popular involvement and
consultation in equal basis for all parties involved in the Internet Governance process 
9  Protecting consumers  promote trust in the Internet environment and encourage users to organize
themselves for a better care of their interest 
10  Promote the development and innovation on Internet infrastructure and related services through
appropriate public policies; strengthen the national and global digital economy in benefit of all
citizens 
11  Given the special role of governments in areas such as national security and critical infrastructure
stability  they should be active participants in multi stakeholder process 
12  We continue endorsing the Declaration of Principles Building the Information Society  a global
challenge in the new Millennium adopted by the World Summit on the Information Society and the
OECD Principles for Internet Policy-making and we are convinced that this principles are good
bases to be adopted as part of Internet Governance Principles 
Roadmap for the Further Evolution of the Internet Governance Ecosystem
The Internet Governance Forum (IGF) established by the United Nations according with the Tunis
Agenda and the corresponding Resolutions of their General Assembly  represent a substantial element
to analyze the current status of the global ecosystem  We identify the following key elements which
can be improved through mutual cooperation 
1  IGF shall be the main forum where all stakeholders can participate and disseminate good practices
and lessons learned  Similar efforts at regional and national levels should be a recommendation  In
this sense  we encourage the UN to renew the IGF mandate for another 10 years  in addition to the
permanent evolution and continuity of the Multistakeholder Advisory Group (MAG)  in recognition
of the thorough  objective and inclusive representation of the wide diversity of stakeholders
involved on the Internet 
2  Continued compliance with the United Nations System and monitoring of emerging issues where a
global public policy could be identification of appropriate bodies to handle each matter  and
improvement of the measures to facilitate the multi-stakeholder involvement 
3  The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) should evolve to comprise a
more internationalized organization under the most suitable regime for multi-stakeholder
participation  on the basis of equality  openness  bottom-up and rough consensus  on the
understanding that the proper application of these within the organizational structures will avoid
control by any particular stakeholder  The same should be endorsed for the internationalization of
the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) functions currently under ICANN administration
by contract with the US Department of Commerce (US DoC)  As Internet policy discussions
become more global in nature  stakeholders should continue to rely on the existing structures to
develop global policies that benefit all users rather than relying on either the creation of another
governance body or on multilateral means 
4  All of the stakeholders involved should increase their accountability and transparency practices in favor of the global Internet community public interest  Recognizing necessary improvements within the current governance model  we propose bringing new stakeholders whose voices may not be effectively heard into the conversation  For example  through the offer of fellowships to engineers and policymakers from the developing world to attend multi-stakeholder meetings  as well as improving transparency and accountability  calling on all involved organizations to make relevant governance and policy documents available to all stakeholders at no cost and opening governance meetings to equal participation whenever possible 
5  International organizations and governments should enhance their cooperation in order to mitigate any conduct contrary to the use of the Internet for the economic and social development  taking into account the potential for improvements in the international mechanisms of cooperation among stakeholders  In addition  considering that in some cases of Internet Governance  private mechanisms aimed at specific expertise areas and non-State forms of cooperation are currently undergoing and working properly among the stakeholders involved  we recommend that these should be recognized  endorsed  and not duplicated within other State cooperation mechanisms in order to avoid effort duplication and regulation spheres 
6  The technical community and International Organizations should continue improving their mutual cooperation for the elaboration of the standards in favor of the interoperability  security and stability of the Internet  We encourage the internet governance community to maintain and endorse the Internet Governance Principles defined by the Technical Community 1 as follows 
a  Open and inclusive participation 
b  Consensus-based 
c  Permission-less innovation 
d  Collective stewardship and empowerment 
e  Transparency 
f  Pragmatic and evidence-based approach 
g  Voluntary adoption 
7  Promote the development of effective policies and mechanisms to tackle the massive unsolicited communications (spam) and threats of hacking and cybercrime 

1  Expected Actions at Sao Paolo meeting
It is obvious that the two days meeting in Sao Paolo would not be expected to take any action  discuss or engage in creating solutions for specific topics such as security  privacy  surveillance  etc  but produce universal Internet principles and an institutional framework for multistakeholder Internet governance  The framework will include a roadmap to evolve and globalize current institutions  and new mechanisms to address the emerging internet governance topics and agree on a final declaration aimed to be concrete/practical  linked to Internet governance initiatives  and include next steps (agreed roadmap) 
There are many discussions on-going with respect to next steps (the future of Internet Governance)  One key question is the role of governments in Internet governance arrangements  A complaint often heard by governments is that they are confused and in fact they don’t know their way around in the distributed Internet ecosystem and they think that nobody is dealing with public policy issues such as spam or cybersecurity or network security  To address this  there have been calls for building a new framework for evolved Internet Governance arrangements 
The key point is that there is a need for something new  be it an institution or mechanism; and to thoroughly review all possible options 
The options range from continued evolution (largely along the trajectories we see today -WSIS/Tunis Agenda  Enhanced Cooperation  and re vitalized/strengthened IGF  current institutions  increased outreach-) to an entirely new framework/institution/clearing house/help-line(s) 
Various Internet Governance processes and events will be taking place this year  some in parallel streams; these events are expected to shape Internet policy in a substantial way  Apart from the Global Multistakeholder Meeting on the Future of Internet Governance  which are being take place in São Paulo  Brazil  on 23-24 April  other events include meetings organized by ICANN  the ITU  UN bodies (UNGA  UN Human Rights Council)  the World Economic Forum  and of course  the 9th Internet Governance Forum in Istanbul in September 2014
Details of these events are summarized below for easy reference
? Brazil’s Global Multistakeholder Meeting on the Future of Internet Governance  taking place 23-24 April in São Paolo  has a two-fold direct focus  IG principles  and a roadmap for the further evolution of the IG ecosystem 
? The 1Net initiative  resulting from the Montevideo statement by the I* set of organizations (ISOC  ICANN  IAB/IETF  IANA and the 5 RIRs and W3C)  is an (online) discussion platform connecting various constituencies throughout the year(s)  1Net aims to contribute to major IG forums (starting with the Brazil meeting) with ‘actionable collaborative solutions’ on  most likely  topics related to the Montevideo statement  Internet operations and ICANN/IANA functions  surveillance  global IG multistakeholder cooperation and equal participation of all (including governments)  dangers of fragmentation  and IPv6 deployment 
? ICANN’s High Level Panel on Global Internet Cooperation and Governance Mechanisms  which is expected to deliver a report by the summer of 2014  seems to focus on the ‘desirable properties’ of the future IG process  ecosystem legitimacy  effective and inclusive consensus-based system  ensuring global participation including from the developing world  and the co-existence of various governance mechanisms (national and multilateral) 
? CIGI and ChathamHouse’s ‘Global Commission on Internet Governance’  as it seems from the address by its head  Swedish foreign minister Carl Bildt  and news coverage  should have a two-year mandate and primarily focus on state censorship  privacy  and surveillance  through online discussions and several meetings 
? The Geneva Internet Platform (GIP) will focus mainly on Geneva-based IG activities  It aims to assist diplomatic missions based in Geneva  international organizations  and other players in covering IG issues  The main focus will be in addressing the cross-cutting
aspect of IG beyond policy silos  The GIP will include both online activities such as capacity building programmes and diplomatic webinar briefings  and in situ sessions  briefings  and conferences like the one planned in Geneva on 19-20 June 2014  which will focus on the results of the São Paolo conference 
? The EU Global Internet Policy Observatory will be an online communication and database platform for knowledge and experience sharing across stakeholders worldwide  The GIPO should monitor IG policies  provide links across various initiatives  briefings  and reports on policy trends and processes 
At the basis  the UN’s Internet Governance Forum  whose 9th global meeting will take place 2-5 September 2014 in Istanbul  Turkey  thematically covers the widest possible range of IG topics; the agenda of the annual event is shaped by the Multistakeholder Advisory Group (MAG) based on public input and will likely reflect the top trends raised in other forums as well  While it is a non-decision-making forum  the recent UN CSTD recommendations on the IGF improvements suggest moving towards more tangible outputs that can serve as ‘messages’ or non-binding policy recommendations – possibly akin to the IETF’s 'Request for Comment' (RFC) documents on technological standards 
The CSTD Working Group on Enhanced Cooperation discussing the role of governments in the IG process  regular ICANN meetings  the global Freedom Online conference  the ITU World Telecommunication Development Conferences (WTDC) and its Plenipotentiary Conference  etc  On top of this  of course  the WSIS+10 Overview process  culminating with the WSIS+10 events in 2015 - all feeding into a global millennium development goals (MDG) review 
There should therefore maintain some coherence and harmonization in the activities currently being carried out in many for a as outlined above otherwise overlapping and duplication of works would undermine the objectives and roadmap to be established in Brazil’s meeting Root Zones Immunity
The root zone has been one of the most controversial issues in the internet governance debate  Since the first days of the World Summit of Information Society back in 2002  the theoretical possibility of removing other countries’ domain names - by deleting the country’s domain name from the Internet - has inspired many countries to criticize the USA’s key role in the management of the root zone database  An overwhelming majority of countries argue that the root zone in an Internet as a global infrastructure should be managed by an international organization which is not under the control or jurisdiction of any single country  This argument is often framed as a question of sovereign equality  and fairness in international relations dealing with Internet One option could be making the server and root database inviolable  in particular from any national jurisdiction  This possibility opens the question of where the root server will be located to ensure immunity from any national jurisdiction 
One could also consider assigning root zone file immunity as part of a re-structured ICANN+ arrangement (making the new /re-structured ICANN an international organization which is the main these of the Brazil’s meeting  Internet Governance architecture
The hottest issue is how to achieve the right balance between Internet functionality (run by private sector and non-government actors) and the need for legitimacy (high involvement of governments)  The new Internet ecosystem  as it is sometimes labelled  will be at the top of the agenda of the São Paulo meeting and undoubtedly other meetings during 2014 
Human rights issues will be another hot issue due to its relevance for the Internet business model  the discussion will be framed between two sets of human rights  freedom of expression and privacy/data protection  Both of them directly affect the Internet industry’s revenues; the more data that is shared on the Internet  the higher the revenue  Data protection and cloud regulation 
Some trends of data protection are the extent to which individuals can ‘trade’ their data (e g  a more explicit arrangement between the Internet industry and users about ‘buying’ private data and the tendency of countries and regions to retain as much data as possible on servers located within their territories  Cybersecurity
Cybersecurity has been a constant focus of digital politics  This includes discussions on achieving a balance with human rights issues (e g  cybersecurity and the protection of privacy)  Intellectual Property Rights
Intellectual Property Rights is another area which stayed in the ‘policy shade’ in 2013  It is a structural issue of digital politics which is likely to re-emerge in 2014 
The above issues are among the hot points in further development of the new mechanism to be addressed in Brazil meeting  the principle of which to be included in the list of topics under  Principles

5  Roadmap
5 1  The conference/ Meeting needs to established and agreed on a very clear and well defined roadmap on how to achieve the objectives determined by the meeting in respecting and implementing the above-mentioned principles;
5 2  It is obvious that the issue of globalization of Internet Governance using an appropriate  Multistakehiolder Model  within a  Multistakehiolder Approach having so many stakeholders players with different status and respective roles and missions coupled with a an appropriate policy making entities and associated structure and composition in a transparent  democratic  inclusive manner each playing their respective role with equal footing as well as deciding on an appropriate Policy Implementing entity together with its relevant the required restructuring of the existing entity and its constituency in respecting several principles for their implementation and putting into operation is a quite complex task;
5 3  Two possible short/medium term and long term deadline could be discussed

5 3 2  Long term deadline would be an issue to be discussed and agreed upon;
5 4  For the short/medium term period at least two additional meetings apart from the Brazil’s meeting may be considered  One toward the end of 2014  after the ITU Plenipotentiary Conference ending Early November 2014 and another one before the UN General Assembly in 2015 with a view that the outcome of the third meeting (in form of Declaration  Report  Summary of Discussion or Recommendation )be contributed to the latter UN meeting;
5 5  For the long term period between one to two additional meetings apart from the mentioned under short term/medium term meeting may be considered  One after the United Nations General Assembly in 2015 (March-April 2016) and the second one  if necessary  toward the end of 2016  The long term (last) meeting should provide an agreed resolution of the matter;
5 6  Whether or not the end results are submitted to the United Nation General Assembly in 2017  is a matter to be further discussed and decided upon by the long term meeting;

Global Multi-Stakeholder Meeting on the Future of Internet Governance/NETmundial
Sao Paulo  April 23-24
Contribution from the Government of Canada
The Government of Canada welcomes the opportunity to contribute to the discussion at the Sao Paulo NETmundial meeting in the elaboration Internet governance principles and a roadmap for the further evolution of the Internet governance ecosystem  We appreciate the opportunity to participate in the NETmunidal meeting  and look forward to a broad and inclusive multistakeholder discussion 
Internet Governance Principles
Canada’s vision of the Internet is one which is free  open and secure  We envision a future in which  individuals in every corner of the globe can easily connect to the Internet  information and ideas flow freely online  individuals’ rights and freedoms are protected  networked technologies continue to generate prosperity and spur innovation  and in which our information and digital infrastructure are protected 
Canada recognizes importance of efforts taking place in a range of organisations in support of the development of Internet principles to reflect national  regional  and international priorities  Canada also acknowledges the key principles established by the World Summit on the Information Society (WSIS)  Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) Principles for Internet Policy Making  the G8 Deauville declaration  Human Rights Council Resolution 20/8  and the Freedom Online Coalition founding declaration as significant contributions to the wider discussion of Internet governance principles  The Principles for the Governance and Use of the Internet developed by the Brazil Internet Steering Committee are a particularly noteworthy example at the national level 
We are optimistic that the NETmundial meeting provides an opportunity to take stock of these previous efforts  to find the common ground and to contribute to the current and future discussions on Internet Governance issues  In order to achieve this objective  Canada believes our discussions would benefit from the following principles with the following qualities 
- High-level in nature in order to stand the test of time in a fast-changing  technology driven environment;
- Drawn from common provisions found in previous articulations of Internet principles  existing international law and based on Internet-related tenets that already enjoy widespread or universal support;
- Reflect a consensus among all stakeholders within the global Internet community 
2
Canada offers the following principles which  in our view  reflect these qualities and which will serve to
foster an environment for an Internet which is free  open and secure 
A Free Internet
Promote and Protect Human Rights - Respect for human rights  including expression 
association  and privacy-related rights is essential in promoting and preserving a democratic
society  The same rights apply equally online as they do offline 
Universality – Access to information on the Internet should be universal and non-discriminatory 
Rule of law – Laws  regulations and policies applicable to the Internet are transparent and
respect the rule of law  International law and other traditional norms of behaviours that govern
state relations  including international human rights law and international humanitarian law
apply online as they do offline 
An Open Internet
Inclusive Multistakeholder Decision-making – Stakeholders from across the global Internet
community  including Internet users  business  expert technical organizations  and governments
collectively develop policies and make decisions based on consensus in a transparent and
inclusive manner 
One global Internet– Commitment to the Internet as a single  interoperable and unfragmented
technology to allow Internet users to innovate and capture the social and economic benefits 
Foster Innovation and Economic Growth - It is critical that the international community rally to
preserve and foster an online environment that promotes  rather than constrains dynamism and
human creativity  Internet governance must be undertaken in a way to encourage innovation
and promote economic growth and development  Reinforcing an open and decentralized
Internet will bring economic benefits to all  By 2017  over a billion new Internet users are
expected to come online  with the vast majority connecting via mobile devices in the global
south  It will be important to ensure that these new Internet users are able to contribute and
influence outcomes as part of the multistakeholder decision-making processes at the relevant
institutions  including those in place to address Internet technical matters 
A Secure Internet
Promoting security – Internet users must be able to have trust and confidence that they are safe
online and not be subject to malicious cyber activity  All stakeholders have a role to play in
improving security of digital networks that support economic prosperity and social
development 
Stable  Secure and Resilient – The security  stability and resiliency of the Internet is of
paramount importance and all stakeholders must work together to ensure that it is preserved 
3
A Roadmap for the Future Evolution of the Internet Governance Ecosystem
A Strengthened Multistakeholder model – The multistakeholder model of Internet governance has been a key driver in the success of the Internet to date  Canada firmly supports this model and believes it must continue to be the foundation for all discussions in order to preserve the Internet’s open architecture  Canada firmly supports strengthening this model  Government centric approaches would stifle the innovation and dynamism associated with the Internet  The current model has led to enhanced productivity  innovation and inclusion  creating better quality of life and economic growth in the global digital economy  Canada would not support an existing or new multilateral institution to oversee or manage the Internet ecosystem  Doing so would pose a real risk of diminishing true multistakeholder governance  and replacing it with a state centric  top down approach  Such an approach does not adequately recognize the decentralized nature of the Internet and the need to adapt to rapid technological changes as the Internet evolves 
Support for the further globalization of the Internet technical organizations - Promote inclusivity by working with partners  yet being clear that security and stability is of paramount importance  Canada would be interested in pursuing questions related to further globalization in order to reflect the evolution of the Internet 
An Invigorated Internet Governance Forum (IGF) – Taking into account the recommendations of the Working Group on the Improvements of the IGF  Canada underscores the value of the IGF as a forum for discussion of Internet Public Policy related issues and calls for the extension of the IGF mandate beyond 2015  In addition  it is important that the IGF secretariat be strengthened 

Poland’s food for thought on Internet governance aspects in the
pre-Sao Paulo discussions1 
1  Poland welcomes the convening by Brazil of the Global
Multistakeholder Meeting on the Future of Internet Governance to
Sao Paulo in April 2014  We support the effort to craft globally
accepted Internet Governance Principles and propose a Roadmap for
the further evolution of the Internet governance ecosystem
(Roadmap) and consider it a timely and important event in the
global process of Internet governance  The meeting’s legitimacy will
be dependent on acquiring a genuine and wide support and
involvement of a truly multistakeholder environment  In that context
we share the European Commission’s and many countries’ view  that
the failure of the Sao Paulo Meeting would risk projecting Internet
governance issues back into the intergovernmental fora and
organizations  threatening the multistakeholder model 
2  Poland feels however that there should be no question about the
ultimate objective of this global exercise  Irrespective of which forum
along the way the multistakeholder community convenes to
network  the principal goal to pursue is the unfragmented Internet
which should stay free  innovative and open  A globally accepted set
of principles should serve as a means to that end  Poland believes
that this is a task for the stakeholders to effectively participate in the
development of such principles  They should constitute the
underlying basis in any discussions or any related framework of
Internet governance  In this light the Sao Paulo meeting becomes
particularly useful 
3  Poland  inspired by the objectives listed in the Internet Governance
Council of Europe Strategy 2012-20152 and having in mind the
ultimate goal of the free  innovative  open and unfragmented
Internet  believes that the Internet Governance Principles as well as
the Roadmap must respect and protect core values and features of
Internet such as 
? privacy of Internet users;
? open and free technical standards and protocols;
? human rights and freedoms of Internet users  in particular
freedom of speech  access to information and prohibition of
preventive censorship;
? net neutrality and technological neutrality of the Internet
infrastructure;
? the Internet’s potential to promote democracy and cultural
diversity;
1 Poland continues its active involvement in discussions on Internet governance
advocating for a multistakeholder approach  See Polish EU PRESIDENCY PAPER  Internet
Governance Forum  27-30 September 2011 Nairobi  Kenya
2 CM(2011)175 final
4  The same rights that people enjoy offline must also be protected
online  Poland believes that these values have a unique power of
ensuring inclusiveness for all stakeholders 
5  Building on the Internet Governance Council of Europe Strategy
2012-20153 Poland strongly advocates applying the method of
 doing no harm  to the operational aspects of the Internet as we
know it  Any policy  action or decision  both at the national and
global level  pertaining to the Internet  should be subjected to the
 do no harm  test with criteria based on the above mentioned
values and features of the Internet  Although the Council of Europe
Strategy introduces the  do no harm  principle only to ensure the
application of the European Convention on Human Rights in the
online environment  the application of this rule should be extended
to encompass all values and features of the Internet as mentioned in
previous point 
6  The Sao Paulo Roadmap should respect basic requirements for
strengthening the multistakeholder model  as stated in the latest
Commission Communication on Internet governance4  the main of
which being  transparency of the process  inclusiveness and
balance involving a reasonable effort to reach out to all parties
impacted by a given topic  and holding respective bodies
accountable to all involved in multistakeholder process for actions
taken 
7  It can be assumed that one of the main points of the Roadmap will
be the question of globalization of the ICANN and IANA functions 
This issue has been raised in the Montevideo Statement on the
Future of Internet Cooperation  where leaders of so called technical
organizations  among others issues  called for accelerating the
globalization of ICANN and IANA functions  towards an environment
in which all stakeholders participate on an equal footing  Poland also
shares the concern that delegating IANA functions to ICANN through
a contractual relationship with a single country raises issues
pertaining to inadequate accountability  a lack of transparency and
unbalanced stakeholder influence  Thus Poland will support efforts to
provide for globalization of ICANN and IANA functions within the
scope of the Roadmap 
8  The Roadmap should make a full use of the well-established
frameworks of multistakeholder dialogue  in particular by giving
proper recognition to the Internet Governance Forum (IGF)  with a

view to turning it into an outcome-oriented body  The results of the
Working Group on Improvements to IGF offer valuable ideas in this
respect 
9  Poland remains strongly committed to the multistakeholder model of
Internet governance  and thus welcomes and anticipates any
improvements to the ongoing process  as long as these changes
adhere to the principles of multistakeholderism set out above  One
of the tools strengthening the multistakeholder model is an
extensive use of technology allowing remote participation in
meetings and in decision-making process  helping organizations and
entities  especially from developing countries  to get involved  Truly
multistakeholder model is open and public in nature so all forums
and meetings that address issues related to Internet should be open
to broad participation of all stakeholders

Republic of Korea 
The formidable influence of a globally interconnected Internet in all aspects of our society has raised great concerns on the issue of global Internet governance and the Republic of Korea welcomes this opportunity to participate in a global cooperative discussion regarding this very important issue  
As a country leading the world in cutting-edge Internet technologies  the Republic of Korea perceives global Internet governance issues as one of the most important issues facing our global community The 2013 Conference on Cyberspace that we hosted in Seoul last October highlighted the growing importance of cyberspace as well as the need to strengthen international cooperation in order to achieve overall development for the human society throu2h an open and secure cyberspace  

We would like to express our sincere appreciation to the Brazilian government for taking the initiative in providing opportunity for the various stakeholders of the world to get together to share our views on the Future of Internet Governance  We hope our contributions will be instrumental in developing a model of global Internet governance that will enrich the lives of global citizens  
The tremendous development of the global Internet was made possible by the collective efforts of the various stakeholders in their respective roles adapting to changes in the technological and societal environment  The private sector and the technical community have played important roles in the development and accessibility of a global Internet network and civil societies have made efforts to emphasize the rights as well as responsibilities of the individual users of the Internet  Individual governments have also been committed to the establishment of an efficient domestic network and service while exerting efforts to contribute to the international advancement of the Internet  
Recent global security issues that threaten the rights of the various stakeholders have prompted the urgency for the stakeholders to share their views on the issue of global Internet governance  Existing discussions on the rights and responsibilities of the information society  Internet governance and Internet policy making processes provide us with a general common ground in their declarations’  and the Republic of Korea would like to suggest that the 

1 Declaration of Principles  World Summit on the Information Society (WSIS)  Geneva 2003  Turns Agenda for the Information Society  Report of the Working Group on Internet Governance (WGIG)  CGI br Principles for the Governance and Use of the Internet  OECD Principles for Internet Policy-making  Council of Europe Declaration by the Committee of Ministers on Internet Governance Principles  UN Joint Declaration Concerning the Internet(2011)  Internet Rights and Principles Coalitions Chapter of Human Rights for the Internet  UNGA/Res/67/195  Seoul Framework adopted at Seoul Conference on Cyberspace20l3 

following principles be considered in developing consensus regarding global Internet governance  
(Accessibility) The global and open nature of the Internet is a driving force in accelerating progress towards development iii its various forms  Access to the Internet must be universal  and the accessibility to a secure and open Internet must be ensured  
(Multistakeholderism) Discussions on Internet governance need to involve the participation of all interested stakeholders  including governments  the private sector  technical community  civil society  academia and international organizations in a democratic manner  The multistakeholder process must be truly inclusive and equitable  Further efforts are needed to hilly embrace the global community  particularly the stakeholders lacking sufficient representation in the current Internet governance discussion  
(Flexibility) Discussions on Internet governance should consider more than one single approach or solution  Further  considering the evolving nature of the Internet ecosystem  issues and the approaches to address them should be taken on a case-by-case and area- tailored basis  Continued efforts need to be made to identify the best possible solutions that keep pace with changes in the economy  society and technology  

(Engagement) To build a reliable and legitimate governance mechanism that wins support from all stakeholders  decision-making processes in the scope of Internet governance need to be based on global cooperation among all stakeholders  rather than intermittent  temporary and sector-specific efforts  
(Security) All stakeholders should assume responsibility to enhance the security of information technologies  Efforts should be made to reach a common understanding on Internet security related issues  and to cooperate to collect and disseminate security-related information and exchange good practices among all stakeholders on measures to combat cyber security threats  In addition  to ensure a stable and sustainable development of the Internet  efforts should be continuously made to build consensus on the norms on cyberspace  
(Balance) Capacity building programs need to be expanded in order to increase access to the Internet as a public good and to prevent the unintended consequences of the Internet  It is important to bring the Internet to a wider audience  including developing countries with low penetration  countries with limited or no access to the Internet  and the underserved  and to raise the awareness of the Internet among these stakeholders  while providing support to narrow the digital divide  
The Republic of Korea is strongly committed to an open and secure global Internet based on the principles of multistakeholder participation  Being able to arrive at a consensus on an international level is an essential element in securing the legitimacy of mechanisms devised to realize such principles  We hope that NETmundial will provide the opportunity for all the stakeholders to converge on important principles and mechanisms to build a global Internet for the advancement of all human societies

? Respect Human Rights including freedom of expression
? Protection of privacy
? Protection of the neutrality on the net
? Improving the cultural and linguistic diversity
The roadmap for the further evolution of the Internet governance ecosystem must be in accordance with these principles and should aim to the internationalization of the institutions managing the critical resources in order to insure better coordination of technical agencies while strengthening the role governments with regard to their responsibilities 
Moreover  the Globalization cannot be ensured without a strong stakeholder involvement in technology transfer  capacity building and access to funding for developing countries

The Global Multistakeholder Meeting on the Future of Internet Governance «NETMUNDIAL " to be held in Sao Paulo (Brazil) on 23-24 April 2014 with main objectives the identification and promotion of a Set of universal Internet Governance principles and the roadmap for the further evolution of the Internet governance ecosystem in order to act as a plate-form supporting the Internet catalytic role in the social  economic and human development 
The Tunisian Government proposes the following contribution on the " Internet Governance principles " and the " Roadmap for the further evolution of the Internet governance ecosystem "
- The principles on Internet governance  as set in the two phases of the World Summit on the Information Society (Geneva 2003 - Tunis 2005) and mainly in the " Tunis Agenda " states that  the Internet has evolved into a global facility available to the public and its governance should constitute a core issue of the Information Society agenda  The international management of the Internet should be multilateral  transparent and democratic  with the full involvement of governments  the private sector  civil society and international organizations "remains the basis for multi-stakeholder  democratic and transparent future Internet governance 
- Governments as a public authority in charge of public Internet policy must ensure public interest objectives identified as to permit compliance with the Law and the protection of human rights  fundamental freedoms and democratic values as well as intellectual property and linguistic and cultural diversity  This authority is formalized by the establishment of a technically solid  innovative and secures architecture able to strengthen the trust of Internet users 
- Giving the nature of the Internet as an ecosystem in which each party shall bear its responsibilities  it is necessary to deepen appropriate approaches to self-regulation and co-regulation on the Internet  as a complement to regulatory framework  while ensuring the respect and enforcement of the fundamental rights  transparency  accountability and inclusion of all stakeholders 
- The establishment of technical specifications in a multi-stakeholder approach should be based on effective reciprocal interactions between technical considerations and public policy concerns 
- Trust in the Internet and its governance is a prerequisite for realizing the potential of the Internet as an engine of economic growth and innovation  This trust is established by transparent governance  open  balanced and responsible with respect to the following dimensions 
? Free  universal and affordable access to information 
? Protect Human Rights including freedom of expression 
? Provisions for privacy 
? Protection of net neutrality 
? Improving the cultural and linguistic diversity 
These principles should supply the concrete roadmap for the future development of the ecosystem of Internet governance by identifying the roles and mandates for each stakeholder in the implementation of future action plans 
Considering that The Internet is a global infrastructure  a better global balance among the existing organizations and institutions can increase the legitimacy of governance mechanisms  This balance can be achieved through the agreement between stakeholders in order to achieve the following objectives 
- Accelerating the globalization of the IANA and ICANN  while preserving the continued stability and security of the domain name system 
- Further strengthen the role of the GAC in the ICANN process of decision
- Enabling the IGF forums to develop mechanisms for better implementation of its results
- Develop a global model  fair and transparent for the management of critical Internet resources  which is a global public good  including root server names and numbers 
- Promoting the coordination on the results of meetings organized by various international bodies (UNCTAD   ITU  ICANN   IGF     ) grouping the stakeholders on the future development of the global Internet governance  
- Strengthen national sovereignty under international treaties and the respect the privacy of users 
- Invite stakeholders to develop mechanisms and programs to facilitate technology transfer and capacity building for developing countries  especially in the areas of network technologies and security  as well as regulatory framework and regulation 
- In order to bridge the digital divide stakeholders are encouraged to implement programs and funding mechanisms that can help developing countries to expand access to the Internet at affordable for their citizens
