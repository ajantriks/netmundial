When she addressed the United Nations General Assembly on 24 September 2013 Dilma Rousseff President of Brazil reminded us that In the absence of the right to privacy there can be no true freedom of expression and opinion and therefore no effective democracy 
 
Referring to mass surveillance of Internet communications she stated We face a situation of grave violation of human rights and of civil liberties; of invasion and capture of confidential information concerning corporate activities and especially of disrespect to national sovereignty 
 
In order to address this and other issues of Internet governance she stated 
 
“We need to create multilateral mechanisms for the worldwide network that are capable of ensuring principles such as 
1 - Freedom of expression privacy of the individual and respect for human rights 
2 - Open multilateral and democratic governance carried out with transparency by stimulating collective creativity and the participation of society Governments and the private sector 
3 - Universality that ensures the social and human development and the construction of inclusive and non-discriminatory societies 
4 - Cultural diversity without the imposition of beliefs customs and values 
5 - Neutrality of the network guided only by technical and ethical criteria rendering it inadmissible to restrict it for political commercial religious or any other purposes 
 
These statements are consistent with our understanding of what the Internet is and of why some aspects of the current Internet governance arrangements have been criticized  Our understanding is presented in the papers available at 
http //www apig ch/news 
 
In line with President Rousseff s statement and in line with our understanding of what improvements need to be made to ensure that it continues to develop as a single unfragmented global platform that enables anyone-to-anyone communications we propose the following principles for Internet governance 
 
Recognize that the Internet is an international public network that can only continue to thrive in a multilaterally agreed formal international framework that ensures accountability and transparency  Such a framework must ensure the right means and opportunity to use the Internet to access share and contribute to the development of the full intellectual heritage of mankind without undue costs or hindrances or losses of privacy  And it must ensure that all the world s people whether they currently use the Internet or not are able to influence its governance 
Recognize the need for international agreement to cooperate on security mattersand to avoid unilateral assertions of national laws and to avoid extra-territorial actions In this context states shall individually and collectively endeavour to ensure the security and robustness of international telecommunication networks in a manner that respects and upholds their human rights obligations  Any restrictions on human rights including the right to privacy must be necessary and proportionate as called for by civil society organizations 
Recognize that technical specifications must be consistent with public policy  This is critical because legal rights of individuals including their right to privacy are impacted by technical specifications 
Identify the main difficulties that the digital economy poses for the application of existing international tax rules and develop detailed options to address these difficulties 
Take steps to reduce the cost for developing country users to connect to the Internet in particular as outlined in the relevant ITU-T Recommendations 
Recognize that access to infrastructure is an essential component of the information society  Access must be available at a price that is affordable for users with respect to their disposable income 
Recognize that market solutions will not always result in the rollout of sufficient infrastructure for example in low-density areas In some economies government intervention of some form may be required for some portions of the infrastructure  In this context regulations promoting equal access to infrastructure (sometimes referred to as net neutrality”) may be appropriate 
Agree a formal framework that provides for all governments to participate on an equal footing in the governance and supervision of the ICANN and IANA functions and that provides for effective supervision and accountability of these functions in accordance with paragraphs 29 35 36 61 and 69 of the Tunis Agenda 
ISOC-Yemen welcomes the opportunity to participate in the Global Multistakeholder Meeting on the Future of Internet Governance  As a [discussion nature of organization and interest in the multistakeholder model] [organization or organization s members] rely on an open stable secure resilient and interoperable Internet every day  We believe that preserving the multistakeholder model of Internet governance is essential to ensuring that global citizens are able to take advantage of this transformative platform both now and in the future 
 
Below we highlight some high level principles for Internet governance going forward  We believe that these principles will both allow the global Internet community to preserve the open Internet for the billions who currently rely on it in their daily lives and bring its advantages to the 5 billion people who are presently unconnected 
 
Substantive Principles Any Model of Internet Governance Should Promote the Following Principles 
 
  The world deserves the access to knowledge services commerce and communication the accompanying benefits to economic development education and health care and the informed discussion that the Internet provides  Governance should promote expanding access to broadband networks so that these benefits can reach all of the world s citizens 
  The Internet s importance as a platform for commerce for education for information and knowledge sharing for self-expression and for organization and assembly depends on the global free flow of information  Any model for governance must promote this free flow of information 
  Governance should promote the ability to innovate to develop technical capacity and to create and take advantage of economic opportunities  To achieve this end any model of Internet governance must promote the open distributed interoperable and interconnected nature of the Internet 
  Because the Internet is an integral part of the global economy its security stability and resiliency must be preserved 
  Individuals should be able to exercise their human rights both online and offline 
  Governments should recognize limitations on their ability to collect information on Internet users based on users  reasonable privacy interests and the impact on trust in the Internet 
 
Governance Principles Any Model of Internet Governance Should Have the Following Characteristics 
 
  All stakeholders -- individual users governments civil society businesses and members of the academic and technical community -- have a stake in preserving the Internet as a critical platform for communication and information exchange and therefore all stakeholders should be included in governance decisions  All of these stakeholders have contributed to the development of the Internet to date and working together they have driven unprecedented growth in access to uses of and innovation on the Internet  They must continue to be involved in any future model of Internet governance 
  Any policy-making associated with the Internet must promote openness transparency and accountability and must be grounded in respect for the rule of law

Roadmaps for further evolution of Internet governance
 
Over the years there have been numerous proposed roadmaps for further evolution of Internet governance  Some of those proposed roadmaps remain perfectly valid today and they will no doubt be presented again to the Net Mundial meeting 
 
This paper presents some of the proposals that have received less recent attention but which still warrant consideration  This paper is structured into four sections 
 
1 The Internet Ad Hoc Group proposals
2 The Role of the US government
3 Modularization of ICANN s functions
4 Relation to Existing Intergovernmental Organizations
 
1 The Internet Ad Hoc Group proposals
 
The first discussions on how to evolve Internet governance took place in the mid-1990s  ISOC and others sponsored discussions in a fully multi-stakeholder open bottom up group known as IAHC  That group recommended the creation of a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) that would be open for signature by anybody (individual state private company non-profit organization etc ) who adhered to its basic principles  The MoU provided for the creation of a legal structure in the form of a non-profit Swiss association and mechanisms whereby the signatories of the MoU could make decisions and recommendations  The MoU received considerable support and was signed by a certain number of organizations  But the United States rejected the concept of that MoU and issued its Green Paper and White Paper resulting in the creation of ICANN 
 
In retrospect it appears that it would have been better to accept the framework for evolution provided for in the IAHC MoU  Much if not all of that IAHC framework remains valid today and could form the basis for a future framework 
 
A short history of IAHC is available at 
http //en wikipedia org/wiki/IAHC
 
The MoU can be found at 
http //web archive org/web/19971211190034/http //www gtld-mou org/
 
2 The role of the US government
 
In its 5 June 1997 Statement of Policy on the Management of Domain Names and Addresses (commonly referred to as the White Paper”) the US government stated that it would phase out its oversight of the Internet domain names and addresses no later than 30 September 2000 
 
The arguments in favor of such a phase-out remain valid today  Thus any future framework for the evolution of Internet governance must start by reaffirming that there should be no special oversight role by a single government  Any required governmental oversight must be exercised collegially and consensually by all governments who wish to participate in such oversight 
 
3 Modularization of ICANN s function
 
This approach is based on the assumption that it would be difficult to adapt ICANN so that it can be all things to all people  Instead it is proposed to apply the well-known engineering technique of decomposing a difficult problem into smaller modules that can be addressed more easily than the full problem 
 
The approach assumes that the DNS would remain a natural monopoly as it is today  The approach would have to be modified significantly if other models for the DNS were adopted 
 
3 1 Root Server Operations and Content of the Root Zone File
 
Some governments have expressed concern over the fact that the root server operations are currently supervised by only one government that of the USA and that that same government through its Department of Commerce has final approval (or veto) power over any changes to the content of the root zone file 
 
Since the Internet is being increasingly used for e-government and is becoming a critical national infrastructure in many countries many governments feel that while the leadership of the private sector for technical and operational issues must continue some oversight role must be granted to governments other than that of the USA 
 
As noted above at ICANN s creation it was thought that the US government might relinquish its oversight role to ICANN who would it was thought be able to represent the world-wide public interest  However some may not wish to relinquish entirely to a private company what could be considered the residual public policy oversight role for ensuring a stable and reliable DNS which implies stable reliable and secure root server operations and-separately but in relation to operations-fast and consistent implementation of changes to the root zone file in accordance with agreed procedures 
 
3 1 1 Root Server Operations
 
Root server operations are currently considered satisfactory so there are no issues requiring urgent resolution  The issue is rather that there might be calls to ensure the long-term international supervision of root server operations 
 
Root server operations are highly technical and require specialized skills and knowledge  While these are widely available in some countries they are relatively rare in other countries 
 
Thus some countries (in particular the USA) can be expected to contribute more to root server operations than other countries  As a consequence arrangements should be envisaged that would recognize the relative contributions of countries that contribute to root server operations 
 
There are several well-known models for such arrangements in particular Intelsat and Inmarsat  These bodies have evolved from ad-hoc treaty organizations dealing with respectively satellites for telephony and satellites for maritime communications into mixed public-private bodies  Since the Intelsat and Inmarsat experiences are widely viewed as successful we propose to use them as models for a possible future root server operations 
 
Thus the proposal is to create a new inter-governmental treaty organization called INROOTS in this paper which would have the following characteristics 
 
members would be governments and private sector entities who can contribute resources to root server operations;
there would be a two-tier structure with technical and operational matters handled by the private sector bodies and governments providing a supervisory function;
voting would be weighted by contributions (technical and financial);
civil society would provide input through the governments and directly to INROOTS through agreed procedures based on those of existing inter-governmental organizations 
 
INROOTS would outsource root server operations including operation of the authoritative root server  Presumably the operations would be outsourced to the same parties that today successfully operate the root server system including ICANN 
 
3 1 2 Content of the Root Zone File
 
INROOTS would certify specific bodies who would have authority to request changes to entries in the authoritative root zone file  We will use the terminology Trustworthy Operator (TWO) for an entity that carries out operational tasks and Policy Decision Forum (PDF) for an entity that carries out policy-making functions  INROOTS would be both a TWO and a PDF where the PDF would relate to root server operational issues (load balancing security reliability etc ) 
 
INROOTS would accept change requests to the root zone file only from specific TWOs who would be formally recognized by INROOTS as being authoritative for certain areas  Each TWO would operate in accordance with policies developed by a specified PDF for that TWO 
 
Specifically there is a recognized operator for each top-level domain (TLD) (for example Versign for  com AFNIC for  fr etc )  These operators would be recognized by INROOTS as the TWO for the TLD which they operate and INROOTS would implement their instructions with respect to the entries in the root file master for the concerned TLD  The PDF for each TLD would be recognized as outlined below  The PDF for each TLD would approve the policies implemented by each TLD when it acts as a TWO 
 
Civil society should be represented in the several PDFs 
 
3 1 3 Issues related to gTLDs
 
Issues related to gTLD policies should be separated from issues related to ccTLD policies 
 
Taking into account the historical situation and the current commercial realities it should be recognized that the gTLDs  com  edu  gov  mil  net  org fall under the primary responsibility of the USA 
 
Thus the US Government (presumably through its Department of Commerce) should designate the TWO and PDF for these domain names  That would be presumably IANA as TWO and ICANN as PDF  Specifically DoC would inform INROOTS of its choices in this area 
 
The gTLD  int is reserved for international treaty organizations  Thus it seems appropriate that the ITU should be the PDF for this gTLD and indeed Recommendation ITU-T E 910 was adopted by consensus  The ITU s TSB should be the TWO where the term TWO is used in this context to refer to administrative control not actual operations; actual operations could be performed by other organizations The actual operation of the  int domain should be performed by an organization that operates other domains  For example the operator of  org could operate  int or ICANN could do it 
 
Issues related to other gTLDs and issues related to the creation of future gTLDs are not addressed in this document 
 
3 1 4 Issues related to ccTLDs
 
Different countries have different policies with respect to Internet in general and their local ccTLD operations in particular  Furthermore policies can be expected to evolve as the nature of Internet usage evolves in any given country 
 
And indeed the current governance arrangements for ccTLDs recognize the diversity of views by explicitly allowing specific PDFs for individual ccTLDs and recognizing a TWO for each ccTLD 
 
However all the TWOs must directly interact with IANA and the process by which they interact with IANA is decided by ICANN  This situation is considered satisfactory by many countries but some countries may prefer to have the option to rely on an alternative top-level TWO and PDF that are not private companies 
 
Thus it is proposed that countries would have the choice of informing INROOTS whether the TWO for their ccTLD would be IANA or ITU-T TSB  In the case of IANA the PDF would be ICANN  In the case of TSB the PDF would be ITU-T (bodies that represent civil society could join the ITU-T and contribute as Sector Members with exemption from payment of membership fees)  It should be noted that TSB could undertake this TWO function only after approval of an ITU-T Recommendation specifying how TSB should carry out these tasks  If ccTLD policies were to be developed within the context of the ITU-T it could be expected that many matters would be considered national matters not subject to discussion within ITU-T  For example issues related to consumer protection competition policies data privacy etc would typically be considered national matters 
 
3 1 5 Issues related to IP addresses
 
The RIRs currently perform IP address allocation in accordance with policies developed by the RIRs themselves  Although there is general satisfaction with the RIRs  performance some questions have been raised with respect to a perceived regional imbalance of IPv4 address allocation and with respect to future policies for IPv6 address allocation 
 
It is proposed that the RIRs in cooperation with the IAB and IETF and in liaison with ITU-T should be recognized as the PDF for IP address issues and that the RIRs should designate one or more entities as the TWO for the top-level assignment of IP address blocks to the RIRs (obvious choices would be the RIRs themselves IANA and/or TSB)  It is proposed that the RIRs be recognized as the PDF and TWO for the allocation of addresses within their respective regions 
 
3 1 6 Summary table
 
The above proposals can be summarized in the table attached to this article 
 
3 1 7 Conclusions
 
By adopting a modular approach and by allowing more than one entity to add value to the functions currently performed by ICANN under the supervision of the US government a number of issues can be addressed simultaneously in particular calls for continued private sector leadership a recognition of the need to recognize the importance of informed technical advice and calls for governments around the world for ways in which their role as representatives of the public interest can be recognized 
 
4 Relation to Existing Intergovernmental Organizations
 
It is not disputed that many aspects of Internet governance are discussed and even decided in existing intergovernmental agencies such as WIPO WTO OECD Council of Europe (COE) to name just a few  Matters related to the physical infrastructure that constitutes the lower layers of the Internet (including the very important issue of use of radio spectrum) are discussed in ITU 
 
This role of existing intergovernmental organizations is widely albeit not universally accepted  What appears to create controversy are suggestions that there should be greater involvement of intergovernmental organizations in particular for what concerns management of Internet domain names and addresses 
 
Much of the controversy is related to the fact that any such increased involvement of intergovernmental organizations would likely result in a lessening of the current asymmetric role exercised by the US government 
 
Be that as it may it would appear useful to consider such proposals when developing a framework for the future evolution of Internet governance  One such proposal was submitted to the US Department of Commerce in response for a request for comments  It proposed that the oversight role of the US government should be replaced by a weaker oversight by ITU and that a Memorandum of Understanding be signed between ICANN and the ITU see 
http //www ntia doc gov/legacy/ntiahome/domainname/dnstransition/comments/dnstrans_comment0081 htm 
 
That proposal can be summarized as follow 
 
Administration of the Internet Domain Name System (DNS) comprises two types of activities agreeing policies for the assignment of certain resources and administering a database or other record of the assignments made  We will refer to these two different activities as the Policy Function (PF) and the Administration Function (AF) 
 
The resources in question are entries in the source (or master) root file (RF) IP addresses (IP) and protocol parameters (PP) 
 
In addition administration of the DNS comprises developing policies related to operation of root servers (RS) and administration of those policies (that is ensuring that the actual operations are carried out in accordance with the agreed policies) 
 
And it comprises developing policies related to the operation of gTLDs and ccTLDs and administration of those policies 
 
In the figures that follow NRO refers to Numbering Resource Organization which comprises the Regional Internet Registries (RIRs) 
 
Figures A 1 and A 2 (attached to this article) represent the present relations amongst various bodies 
 
As shown in figures A 1 and A 2 the US government has a direct supervisory role with respect to various bodies  In some cases a government supervisory role is not needed (in particular for the administration function) in other cases (in particular the policy function) it can be exercised by an intergovernmental body and the ITU could be asked to create a specialized group that could carry out that function in agreement with ICANN the agreement to be formalized in a Memorandum of Understanding between ICANN and ITU 
 
Figure B 1 (attached to this article) shows the proposed alternative to the current situation 
 
Such an arrangement could be used to correct the strange anomaly of ICANN s Government Advisory Committee which gives non-binding advice to ICANN and whose representative to the ICANN Board does not have voting rights 
 
Indeed it is generally (albeit not universally) accepted that as called for in the Tunis Agenda governments have responsibility for public policy issues  Since some decisions made by ICANN do have public policy implications it appears strange to relegate governments to a subsidiary role within ICANN 
 
Further it is unusual (to say the least) for governments to constitute a sub-committee of the board of a private company which is what ICANN is 
 
A Memorandum of Understanding between ITU and ICANN could foresee that the GAC would become a group within ITU thus gaining in legitimacy and accountability 
PREAMBLEThe purpose of this declaration is to articulate public expectations on internet freedom in Nigeria that is subscribed to by stakeholders and most importantly the citizens of the country 
 
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
The exercise of human rights on the Internet is an issue of increasing interest and importance as the rapid pace of technological advancement and the constant evolution of pervasive digital mediums give rise to novel legal rights obligations and scenarios 
 
We believe that the same rights that citizens have offline in accordance with the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria 1999 (as amended) must also be protected online and should not be held to different standards 
 
 
INTERNET SURVEILLANCE AND LAWFUL INTERCEPTION
Citizens and lawful residents of Nigeria should be able to send electronic communications to one another free from the fear of surveillance monitoring interception or any other violation of privacy Where interference is unavoidable for the purpose of security such interference must follow clearly defined processes as laid down by law 
 
DATA AND INFORMATION PRIVACY
1 We believe that there should be clarity on the means by which the private data of individuals stored by intermediaries can be accessed Requests for private data should follow legally stipulated procedures and court warrants should be necessary in order for an intermediary to honour a request for private data This data request must be reported to the concerned individual 
2 Every private entity in Nigeria holding citizen data - personal details of private individuals - should release periodic reports detailing the nature and frequency of government requests 
3 All entities that collect store and/or process personal data in the course of their activities should have data privacy policies that are readily and easily accessible to the public 
4 The National Assembly should pass a Data and Information Privacy Law to codify the rights of citizens in connection with data gathered about them 
 
ACCESS AND CONTENT
1 The right of citizens to access the Internet for the purposes of information gathering or sharing conducting business and/or expressing personal opinion must be guaranteed It should be illegal for government or any entity to deny or censor access to the internet without providing adequate and acceptable reasons 
2 Individuals and institutions have the right to create and access content on the Internet and such content should not be subject to censorship Notwithstanding the provisions of this paragraph the relevant laws shall apply in cases where the content infringes on the rights of another citizen 
 
FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION
1 Pursuant to the foregoing general principles we believe that freedom of expression and association as guaranteed by section 39 of the constitution also apply to the internet activities of Nigerian citizens and are thus sacrosanct to the extent that they do not infringe on the rights of other citizens or constitute offences as stipulated by the constitution 
2 The forms of speech protected shall extend to novel forms of conversation introduced by digital mediums which include but are not restricted to retweets likes favourites shares online comments joining groups on social networking sites and so on All of these constitute speech and should enjoy the protected status of fundamental human rights 
 Internet Governance today

The Internet today concerns and affects everybody everywhere connected or not! How the Internet is operated and governed is a topic as significant as the environment human rights and peace Today s Internet Governance has to struggle with three basic characteristics 

 
1 Public commons versus private ownership

 

The character of the Internet as a shared human commons is unique On the one hand it is a shared environment; on the other hand it is based on a physical infrastructure and has limited resources that have owners with their specific investments and interests 

 
2 Sovereignty versus the geography of cyberspace

 

The Internet Ecosystem by its very nature does not care too much about physical boundaries This is the fundamental reason why countries whose authority is based on territory and the concept of sovereignty struggle to find their place in a digital world The uncontrolled free flow of data together with the ongoing speed of innovation seems to be irreconcilable with the concepts of national territory and sovereign rights 

 
3 New forms of sovereignty and governance

 

Similar to nation states many of those organizations and individuals involved in the Internet Ecosystem and its governance commonly known as the stakeholders claim sole-sovereignty” or self-proclaimed sovereignty over specific issues roles and functions The stability and security of the DNS telecommunication standards security and human rights to name just some are well defined subject-territories” in the Internet Ecosystem 

 

Cyberspace today requires a new understanding of sovereignty Sovereignty in the context of Internet Governance is fundamentally different from the traditional understanding of sovereignty as it is not based on geographical territories and treaties but on the ability of a stakeholder or a group of stakeholders in Cyberspace to have specific expertise and/or infrastructure that is relevant to the Internet Ecosystem and to have the capacity to manage the decision-making and implementation processes in a timely and effective way 

 
Bridging the Sovereignty Gaps Knowledge and Awareness Building and a New Understanding of Multi-Stakeholderism

 

Nobody should interfere in the specific sovereignty and governance of nation states Equally it is the sole role responsibility and privilege of all Internet Ecosystem stakeholders to exercise their sovereignty These gaps can be bridged and turned into a constructive force when all those exercising sovereignty in Cyberspace recognize that their own legitimacy development and sustainability is dependent on 

 

    the availability of suitable instruments for internal and external awareness-building knowledge exchange and processing 
    the establishment of a new understanding of multi-stakeholderism that is based on inter-sovereignty collaboration and joint implementation 

 

The need for Knowledge Exchange and Awareness Building

 

The uncomfortable fact remains true that Cyberspace today resembles a country where 1% of the population governs 99% of the population and 98% of these don t even know that the 1% exist! This represents a real legitimacy problem for all current IG processes and sovereignty claims Real development and sustainability can only happen if it is based on knowledge that is available to everybody in appropriate forms and not just to a self-elected elite Different sovereignties have their own governance structures and there are attempts to create joint governance structures but they can only be legitimate and successful if they put the awareness building and empowerment of their citizens and that of the citizens in other spheres at the center of their thinking and doing All governance structures for Cyberspace should be citizen-centric 

 

It also has to be recognized that neither nation states nor the Internet ecosystem stakeholders are limitless in their abilities to build Awareness and exchange Knowledge even if they have a strong desire and need Their abilities are limited by and directly proportionate to the availability and nature of the instruments they have available Therefore the immediate goal has to be to create suitable instruments and tools 

 

Another look at the multi-stakeholder model

 

Multi stakeholderism has been the central concept for IG until today Despite the many problems and frustrations the stability and security of the DNS throughout the years and the quality of service it provides are reason enough to described it as a success 

 

The multi-stakeholder model under strain

 

With the crowing impact and complexity of Cyberspace the sovereignty gaps between stakeholders have become more obvious and are increasingly causing contention A closer look at these conflicts reveals that the real problem is based in the confrontation of 2 different fundamental sovereignties a) the sovereignty that is inherit in the decision making processes and b) the sovereignty that is inherit in the processes of implementation 

 

A multi-stakeholder process that is following the best principles of inclusion transparency and applied knowledge will usually come up with good decisions but these decisions might look rather questionable when seen out of the perspective of implementation 

 

One example that stands for many is security in Cyberspace Security can and has to be legislated but it also has to be implemented The best security legislation is useless when it is overridden on the implementation level for whatever reason In many cases reality shows that those who are legislators distrust those who are implementers and vice versa The reason for this distrust is that they both feel that the needs and sovereignty they represent are not been taken into account adequately As a result Cyberspace is not only divided in itself its existence threatened by clashing understandings of sovereignties 

 

A new understanding of multi-stakeholderism

 

The only way to overcome the legislation/implementation sovereignty problem is to create and implement a new understanding of multi-stakeholderism that is based on bringing together the decision making and implementation processes 

 

To bring them together requires 

 

    the understanding and respect of the stakeholders of their respective roles 

    the understanding of their inter dependency

    the instruments of joint implementation

 

Multi-stakeholderism in IG today needs to express itself in tangible practical forms of working together and joint implementation It simply makes sense business sense development sense common sense and so on as it is taking the concept of creating win/win situations seriously The successful execution of someone elses sovereignty becomes vital for my own interest The gain that specific IG stakeholders will experience is ultimately the reason why they will accept and participate in joint implementations as it is in their own interest New multi-stakeholderim in Internet Governance is a key factor for economic development The real reformation in IG will come from no longer perceiving sovereignties as competing entities but as implementation partners that are vital to ensure my own specific needs and interests 
The need to abolish stakeholder roles”

Submitted by Milton Mueller with the support of the ICANN Noncommercial Stakeholders Group

 

This paper proposes a new principle for Internet governance The principle can be stated 

 

In multistakeholder institutions for global Internet governance all individuals – regardless of whether they are agents of governments international organizations the technical community the private sector civil society or interested individuals – should have equal status as participants in the formulation of public policies 

 

This principle is intended to clarify issues and overcome problems that were encountered during the World Summit on the Information Society (WSIS) 

 

WSIS was the first direct engagement between the intergovernmental UN system and the multistakeholder methods of the Internet Back in 2003 it was probably inevitable that representatives of governments would not fully understand or accept the multistakeholder model Still great progress was made The Working Group on Internet Governance (WGIG) and the final documents produced by the WSIS (the Geneva Resolutions and the Tunis Agenda) embraced multistakeholder concepts in their definitions of Internet governance 

 

There was however an important flaw in the WSIS documents In attempting to find a middle ground between the multistakeholder model and the intergovernmental system the Tunis Agenda attempted to put different stakeholder groups into specific ‘roles   These roles elevated representatives of national governments above all other stakeholders 

 

    ‘Policy authority  and ‘public policy making  was reserved to sovereign states
    The private sector was assigned responsibility for ‘technical and operational matters  that ‘do not impact on international public policy issues 
    Civil society was given a subordinate role The WSIS resolutions stated that civil society ‘has played an important role on Internet matters…at the community level  

 

Time has proven this division of stakeholder groups to be ambiguous unworkable and undesirable 

 

     In many aspects of Internet governance implementing policy decisions requires direct interaction with technical and operational matters Making policy often requires deep knowledge of the constraints imposed by technology and operations That knowledge can only come from the direct participation of private sector and technical community participants as equal-status actors in the policy process 
    When states refer to ‘public policy  related to the Internet they must understand that the relevant ‘public  is transnational not national; states therefore are only partial and imperfect representatives of the global public 
    The document does not even specify what civil society s role is other than saying it is ‘important  
    Civil society actors are not necessarily restricted to the local ‘community ; they are increasingly transnational in their advocacy of important human rights and policy principles And they often advocate public policy positions that are different from those of their government The Internet creates a global political community To be fully democratic global policy making must allow all these voices to be heard and it must give non-state actors the same status as state actors 
    In global Internet governance the quest for ‘sovereignty  is futile Governments can and do regulate some aspects of Internet policy in their own jurisdictions but effective and beneficial policies often need to be global or transnational especially policies pertaining to the coordination of critical Internet resources 
    It should be noted that in defining these roles the governments who negotiated the WSIS documents did not ask for or obtain the agreement of the other stakeholder groups 

 

We ask the Global Multistakeholder Meeting on the Future of Internet Governance to formally challenge the Tunis Agenda s definition of stakeholder ‘roles  by adopting the ‘equal status  principle stated above We ask that the Meeting overtly recognize and defend the modifications of traditional policy making authority inherent in the multistakeholder model 

 

The advocates of this new principle recognize that there are numerous areas where the traditional role of the state is appropriate and necessary such as legislation and law enforcement in territorial jurisdictions Yet because so much of the policies and services of the Internet are transnational we believe that Internet governance must change their traditional roles and give all stakeholders the same status in the formulation of policy 
Offline rights apply equally online 

 

This is a general legal principle whose origin can be traced back to telegraphy and that is well established by law and precedent in numerous jurisdictions see for example section 2 of Hill Richard 2014 The Internet its governance and the multi-stakeholder model” Info Vol 16 No 2  An early version of that section is available at 

 

  http //www apig ch/Internet%201-paradigm doc

 

The principle that offline rights appy equally online is enshrined in two recent UN Resolutions which affirm that the same rights that people have offline must also be protected online  Those resolutions are A/HRC/RES/20/8 The Promotion protection and enjoyment of human rights on the Internet; and A/RES/68/167 The right to privacy in the digital age  These resolutions are available at 

 

  http //ap ohchr org/documents/dpage_e aspx si=A/HRC/RES/20/8

 

  http //www un org/en/ga/search/view_doc asp symbol=A/RES/68/167

 

Article 21 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and Article 25 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights provide that everyone has the right to take part in the conduct of public affairs directly or through freely chosen representatives  That is everyone has the right to take part directly or through freely chosen representatives in public policy decisions where public policy decisions” refers to decisions that affect public affairs 

 

This human right of course also applies to public policy decisions regarding the Internet by virtue of the principle that offline rights apply equally online 

 

Thus the principle that people either directly or through their freely chosen representatives have the right to make public policy decisions also applies to public policy decisions regarding the Internet  This principle is correctly embodied in 39(a) of the Tunis Agenda which states that policy authority for Internet-related public policy issues is the sovereign right of States 

 

Various calls for non-government entities to participate on an equal footing or on an equal status with governments in decision-making regarding public policy matters would appear to be inconsisent with fundamental human rights because such non-government entities may not be democratic and would likely weaken the right of people to take part in the conduct of public affairs through their chosen representatives 

 

Indeed private companies are not democratic entities and most people do not have any influence in the choice of the people who represent private companies in a multi-stakeholder process  Civil society organizations are typically membership organizations and again most people do not have any influence in the choice of the people who represent civil society organizations in a multi-stakeholder process 

 

A system in which public policy decisions are made by direct democracy that is by directly consulting all people would be consistent with the human rights cited above but it is hard to see how to create such a system in particular because it has to allow all people not just Internet users to influence the decision-making process  And this because the Internet affects non-users as well as users and its use should be extended to all of the world s people 

 

We therefore propose the following fundamental and over-arching principle for Internet governance 

 

1) The same rights that people have offline must also be protected online including the right to take part directly or through freely chosen representatives in public policy decisions  Consequently as stated in paragraph 39(a) of the Tunis Agenda policy authority for Internet-related public policy issues is the sovereign right of States 
 The African Charter on Human and Peoples  Rights is comprehensive in its coverage and protection of human rights in particular civil liberties relating to the rights to receive information express and disseminate opinions within the law However the expressly guaranteed right to privacy” however is notably absent The situation is made worse by the ineffective of remedies caused by the Commission s failure to effectively implement decisions or recommendations in cases in which a state has been found to have violated a guaranteed human right 

 

 

 

The South African Constitutional Court and the South African Human Rights Commission (SAHRC) s advanced best practice in securing the right to privacy online demonstrate that with global support the African Commission s lack of power to ensure redress or punishment for human rights violations does not present an insurmountable obstacle 

 

 In view of the absence of the right to privacy in the African Charter in 2009 the Extra-Ordinary Conference of African Union Ministers in charge of Communication and Information Technologies resulted in the adoption of the Oliver Tambo Declaration directing the African Union Commission to develop a convention on cybercrime jointly with the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa 

 

 This Convention seeks to establish an integrated regional legal framework for cyber security which simultaneously protects the fundamental rights and freedoms of persons affected 

 

 This convention was to take into consideration the African context and adhere to the legal and regulatory requirements on electronic transactions cyber security and personal data protection The Declaration recommended that the Convention be adopted by 2012 

 

 Following this request a process was undertaken to draft a cybercrime law Following first drafts in 2011 and 2012 a final draft of the AU Convention on Confidence and Security in Cyberspace (aka AU Convention on Cyber Security the AUCS”) was put forward by the African Union in 2013 and scheduled for signing in January 2014 at the next Africa Union Summit The signing was postponed 

 

 Despite setting the protection of the rights of persons as its second objective dedicating a section to the right of the person whose personal data are to be processed” some provisions of the draft challenge and/or limit those rights liberties and protections directly such as;

 

•    Disclosure of identity which is a threat to anonymity

 

•   Reliance on national legislation which in itself is often unreliable 

 

•   Incorporation of vague notions of public interest and state security

 

•   Unlimited state power to issue search and seizure

 

•   A further problem with the Convention is the general lack of consultation with non-governmental actors in the drafting process which has attracted considerable criticism 

 

NetMundial Forum therefore offers an opportunity to ensure that African regulatory framework which is currently shambolic benefits from international best practice and comparative experiences that exhibit such best practice thus brining it into line with other regional arrangements such as the European Convention on Human Rights and the Inter-American Convention on Human Rights 

 

Having researched on this issue and presented papers at the Human Rights Council RightsCon and having introduced the subject of digital technology and privacy the Zimbabwe Human Rights Forum is equipped in assisting the process of aligning African regional practice with international best practice 
Roadmap for globalizing IANA Four principles and a proposal for reform
A submission to the Global Multistakeholder Meeting on the Future of Internet Governance
Milton Mueller and Brenden Kuerbis
Introduction
Nongovernmental
administration of the domain name system (DNS) has been a policy goal of the
Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) regime from its inception The 1998
Department of Commerce National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) White
Paper setting the policy framework for ICANN openly recognized that an increasing percentage of
Internet users reside outside of the U S and those stakeholders want to participate in Internet
coordination  The U S proposed to globalize the governance of Internet identifiers by delegating
authority to a private sector nonprofit 
which would govern by means of private contracts The
contracts would reflect policies made by a multistakeholder
process not
by national governments or
intergovernmental treaties (NTIA 1998) 
The U S failed to complete the transition For 16 years ICANN remained a US government
contractor rather than an independent multistakeholder
governance institution But it is incongruous to
allow one national government to have exclusive authority over aspects of Internet governance that are
critical to all states and all peoples In October 2013 the Directors of all the major Internet
organizations agreed ICANN the Internet Engineering Task Force the Internet Architecture Board 
the World Wide Web Consortium the Internet Society and all five of the regional Internet address
registries issued a statement calling for the globalization of ICANN and IANA functions towards an
environment in which all stakeholders including all governments participate on an equal footing 
Agreement on principles and methods for globalizing the IANA function could be a tangible
achievement of the Brazil Meeting A specific blueprint and timetable for this reform should be part of
the roadmap produced by the Brazil meeting This paper sets out a blueprint and supporting analysis In
essence it proposes to 
  Structurally separate the IANA functions from ICANN s policy process
  Integrate the DNSrelated
IANA functions with the Root Zone Maintainer functions performed
by Verisign and put them into a new independent DNS Authority” (DNSA)
  Create a nonprofit controlled by a consortium of TLD registries and root server operators to
run the DNSA 
  Complete the transition by September 2015 when the IANA contract expires
1
Structure of the present system
Root zone management involves four roles that are performed by three different entities through two
separate legal agreements These roles are diagrammed in Figure 1 and described below 
1 The first role is global policy maker for the DNS This role is occupied by ICANN and its
socalled
bottomup
policy development process Formally recognized by the U S in 1999 as
the NewCo” called for in the 1998 White Paper ICANN makes policies that affect the
registries  and registrars  contracts in the generic toplevel
domains and determine what new
top level domains go into the root zone file 
2 The second role is that of the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) Functions
Operator IANA is responsible for managing the content of the root zone based on the policies
adopted by ICANN It transmits requested changes in TLD data to the Root Zone Maintainer
(Verisign) and the Administrator (NTIA) The IANA function is defined by a U S Commerce
Department contract which has been awarded to ICANN 
Figure 1 Internet Root Zone governance structure
3 The third role is the political oversight function referred to as the Administrator” in the IANA
functions contract The Administrator approves any changes additions or deletions from the
root zone file ostensibly to ensure that are authorized by policy This role is currently held by
the NTIA 
2
4 The fourth role is the Root Zone Maintainer This is performed by Verisign under a Cooperative
Agreement with NTIA Verisign is a commercial corporation that operates  com  net and
several other top level domains Amendment 11 of its agreement requires Verisign to implement
only those changes in the root zone file that NTIA approves While IANA is supposed to
determine the content of the root zone file VeriSign (or any successor entity designated by the
Commerce Department) actually edits the root zone data cryptographically signs it (DNSSEC)
and distributes the resulting content to the root server operators 
Why the U S role is a problem
The IANA functions contract does far more than empower the US Commerce Department to authorize
changes to the root zone It regulates very detailed aspects of ICANN s behavior and requires ICANN
to be incorporated in maintain a physical address in and perform the IANA functions in the U S This
makes IANA subject to U S law and provides America with greater political influence over ICANN 
Because the contract must be renewed every three years the U S can modify the contract to shape
ICANN s behavior or threaten to award it to someone else This tie to one government undermines the
global and multistakeholder
nature of Internet governance 
While it is common to assert that the U S has never abused its authority and has always taken
the role of a neutral steward this is not quite true During the controversy over the  xxx domain the
Bush administration caved in to domestic political pressure and threatened to block entry of the domain
into the root if ICANN approved it (Declaration of the Independent Review Panel 2010) It took five
years an independent review challenge and the threat of litigation from a businessman willing to spend
millions to get the  xxx domain into the root Even if this had never happened the U S role has a major 
ongoing impact on the autonomy and integrity of the ICANN policy development process (McGillivray 
2014) The need to regularly renew the contract the fact that the Assistant Secretary of Commerce that
runs NTIA is a political appointee and that NTIA is funded by the U S Congress which can threaten to
cut its budget or pass legislation affecting it all make the claim of neutral stewardship disingenuous 
Furthermore bilateral agreements between ICANN and NTIA such as the Affirmation of
Commitments clearly reflect the policy priorities of the U S government on controversial issues such as
Whois/privacy or encryption standards to cite two examples While some may prefer U S oversight to
oversight by any other government or group of governments those are not the only choices we have 
Four principles to guide IANA contract reform
In this section we make the case for four basic principles that should guide the reform of the IANA
functions 
1 Keep the IANA function clerical; separate it from policy
2 Don t internationalize political oversight end it
3 Align incentives to ensure the accuracy and security of root zone maintenance
4 Delink
globalization of the IANA function from broader ICANN policy process reforms
3
Each of these principles is explained below 
Principle #1 Completely separate root zone file modification from policymaking 
Many observers of the IANA controversy believe that root zone management is an appropriate
site for public oversight and policy intervention This is a mistake The IANA function is a
technicalclerical
task Its purpose is to ensure that all top level domain names are globally unique; that
all technical data in the root zone file correctly maps each domain to the right nameserver IP addresses;
and that requests for changes additions or deletions in the root are accurately and securely executed 
These implementation decisions are completely different from policy development Policy determines
which top level domain names are acceptable how many there should be how they are run etc 
Policy development should take place within ICANN s open process where all stakeholders
can be represented in a balanced manner and there is a welldefined
process for reaching collective
consensus Final implementation of root zone changes authorized by policy should not be a way for
governments (or anyone else) to alter override or block policy decisions made by the multistakeholder
process Nor should control of the root zone be used as leverage for nonDNS
related foreign policy or
economic objectives This implies that the IANA functions should be organizationally separated from
ICANN 
Principle #2 Don t internationalize political oversight end it
Some observers believe that the U S should simply share its unique role as root zone
Administrator with other states They envision a multilateral IANA contract or a new role for ICANN s
Governmental Advisory Committee (GAC) as the Administrator which would see the U S share
oversight authority over IANA equally with all sovereigns This approach however is inconsistent with
Principle #1 Giving additional governments authority over root zone changes reinforces the link
between the IANA function and policy making Multilateral oversight could not avoid making
intergovernmental politics a key factor influencing the IANA functions Governments that opposed the
policies emerging from ICANN might strive for an afterthefact
veto during the approval process The
multilateral option would also make all the world s governments decisionmakers
regarding which
organization would be awarded the IANA functions contract This would encourage geopolitical
struggles over the control of ICANN and it is hard to see how that would make a positive contribution
to global Internet governance 
Principle #3 Align incentives to ensure the accuracy and security of root zone maintenance 
There should be strong safeguards for maintaining the accuracy and security of root zone
changes But a centralized manual review of updates by a government agency or
dozens of them is
a
primitive way to accomplish that goal A better method would be to put IANA functions in the hands of
actors with a strong selfinterest
in ensuring timely service security and accuracy The root zone consists
of data about TLD registries and root servers A registry s customers and reputation suffers if updates
are slow or the data is inaccurate Thus registries have strong incentives to ensure that the data about
4
them are accurate and that changes are securely implemented Our proposal therefore would take the
DNSrelated
IANA functions out of ICANN integrate them with the Root Zone Maintainer functions
currently performed by Verisign and put them into a new independent organization we call the DNS
Authority” (DNSA) The DNSA would be a private nonprofit controlled by a consortium of TLD
registries and root server operators similar to SWIFT in banking and finance In this way root zone
management would be globalized by delegating its operational aspects to all TLD registries including
ccTLDs 
Principle #4 Delink
IANA globalization from broader ICANN reforms
The most troublesome issue concerning IANA globalization is its relationship to accountability 
Many people consider the tether to the U S government an important form of accountability for
ICANN And it is true as IGP and others have pointed out that ICANN s accountability mechanisms
are deficient and badly in need of comprehensive reform (Mueller 2009; Weber and Gunnarson 2010;
IGP 2013) Thus many people conclude that US control of the IANA contract cannot be ended before
ICANN s accountability problems are solved While these concerns are legitimate they do not provide
a good reason to maintain exclusive U S control of the IANA contract 
First the IANA contract does not actually make ICANN accountable to its global community;
it only makes it accountable to Washington That inherently conflates the global public interest with U S 
national interest If ending US oversight is contingent upon ICANN reforms then by definition the USG
will be able to decide unilaterally whether the reforms provide an acceptable basis for letting go That
would give the US government privileged influence over the nature of ICANN well into the future 
Second globalizing IANA as proposed here actually improves the accountability situation The
DNSA structure would introduce an important new safeguard into the way the domain name system is
governed Moving the DNSrelated
IANA functions out of ICANN and into the hands of a neutral
consortium of registries dramatically limits ICANN s ability to go rogue 
Moreover accountability in the execution of the IANA functions and accountability in
ICANN s policy making process are two separate and distinct problems It is easier to solve them
separately than to solve them together Globalizing ICANN will be a complicated undertaking that could
involve reincorporation of ICANN in a new jurisdiction or the negotiation of a new international treaty
instrument (See Corell 2006; Lenard and White 2009; Weber and Gunnarson 2012; Kurbalija 2013;
Cerf 2014) There are diverse views regarding what shape the reforms should take If we link
globalizing the IANA function a
relatively simple widely agreed step to
a complex lengthy and
contentious set of organizational and legal changes related to policy making it could easily prevent any
change at all We therefore favor putting those processes on separate reform tracks 
The proposal
The current IANA contract expires September 30 2015 This date should be taken as the deadline for
globalizing the IANA functions The Department of Commerce has the authority to relinquish its control
by simply walking away from the IANA functions contract when it expires in September 2015 and
5
announcing as a matter of policy that the transition referenced in the 1998 White Paper to NewCo is
finished 
We propose to combine the IANA Functions and the Root Zone Maintainer roles in a new
nonprofit corporation the DNS Authority (DNSA) The DNSA would be exclusively concerned with
the IANA functions related to the DNS root zone and associated databases The IANA functions
related to protocol parameters would be moved to the IETF and the IP addressrelated
functions
would be retained by ICANN until such time as new global policies regarding their disposition could be
developed 
Figure 2 Proposed Internet Root Zone governance structure
The DNSA would be run by a nonprofit consortium of all the firms operating root servers and
domain name registries (i e all companies with top level domains in the root and root servers) just as
some of the early ccTLDs were jointly owned by that country s registrars The owners would include
generic TLD registries such as Afilias and Verisign as well as country code TLD registries such as
DENIC (Germany) and CNNIC (China) This would make governance of the DNSrelated
IANA
functions highly diverse and globalized A one registry one vote structure might best ensure the
neutrality of DNSA governance but other structures (e g basing voting shares and financial support on
the size of the registry) are worth considering as well ICANN currently spends about US$ 7 million
annually on the IANA functions; Verisign s expenditures on the Root Zone Maintainer functions are not
known but are likely to also be in the low millions We propose an initial grant from ICANN of about
$12 million to support the initial formation and early operation of the DNSA; after that the consortium
6
would have to work out a fee structure for its members to support operations 
The DNSA would require a binding contract with ICANN regarding the conditions under which
it would agree to implement changes in the root zone or other associated databases to reflect policies
emerging from ICANN s policy development processes The contract should ensure that the DNSA
has no policy authority but merely implements valid requests for additions or deletions emerging from
ICANN s policy process DNSA would promise to abide by ICANN policy directives on the
condition that ICANN s policy decisions related to the root not be used to impose requirements on
registries via registry agreements to regulate content or otherwise locally lawful behavior of registrants 
The existence of this contract would provide the opportunity for developing an additional accountability
check on ICANN For example if the contract was not in perpetuity but was renewable every five
years diverse entities might compete to replace the existing ICANN as the policy development
authority As for the DNSA as a private association of incumbent registries any attempt by it to
manipulate root zone management to thwart competition or discriminate against eligible members would
be easily challenged by competition law authorities in Europe the U S or elsewhere 
The initial step for executing this proposal should be a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU)
between multiple principals (governments businesses civil society organizations) and the agents
(ICANN and eventually DNSA) Widely used by governments and nongovernments
to coordinate
action in a variety of areas (Aust 1986 2014) a MoU would be a non legally binding amendable
political commitment consistent with the principles and organizational approach outlined above An
MoU or portions thereof could eventually be the basis for development of a treaty if desired by
governments In sum the MoU should 
1 Outline root zone management procedures whereby 
a the IANA Functions and Root Zone Maintainer roles as currently defined are situated
within the DNSA;
b New TLD entries in the root zone redelegating
control of an entry or
decommissioning an entry are validated as authorized by the ICANN board then
implemented signed and distributed to the root servers in ways that can be audited;
c TLD registry and root server operators are able to audit changes to their own TLD
entries in the root zone prior to distribution to the root server operators 
d Appropriate sections of extant registry agreements containing the specific rights and
obligations of ICANN and TLD operators are applied to DNSA s root zone
management procedures 
2 Task a Working Group jointly led by ICANN s Registry Stakeholders Group and its Country
Code Names Supporting Organization (ccNSO) to develop consensus on DNSA governance
(articles of incorporation bylaws and operational rules) The WG should be open to stakeholders
from business civil society individuals from governments and the technical community 
3 Contain an express provision stating that upon a) signing of the MoU by at a minimum the
United States government ICANN 10 gTLD registries 10 accredited registrars 10 ccTLD
operators 10 member organizations of the GNSO Noncommercial Stakeholders Group 10
7
member organizations of the Commercial Stakeholders Group and 10 national governments
and b) operational establishment of the DNSA the IANA Functions Contract and Cooperative
Agreement are terminated by the United States government 
Conclusion
The proposal above would succeed in globalizing the IANA functions strengthening operational
efficiency and improving the accountability of both root zone management and ICANN itself

Roadmap (and principles) for internalisation of the former  IANA functions under a multistakeholder governance model involving  ICANN and associated technical organisations 

This roadmap concentrates on one internet governance issue only – the future of the IANA functions which have been the subject of much past discussion because current arrangements are seen by many to be outside of the preferred multistakeholder model 

 

Indeed IANA itself was established  in an era before most current internet governance institutions (eg ICANN) were in existence The emergence of a trusted global body to take over these functions was envisaged at the time and this submission suggests that we can now proceed to transfer remaining functions to a multistakeholder model of management 

 

ROADMAP

 

This roadmap suggests that the IANA functions (including their oversight) though necessary processes in the secure and authoritative functioning of the Internet no longer need a separate identity and would more productively be merged with similar functions under the auspices of ICANN and associated technical bodies Subject of course to many concerns about details this direction appears to have widespread support from governments civil society technical community and private sector 

 

In order to achieve this desired change efficiently and productively the following roadmap is proposed 

 

1       1 ICANN should be requested to prepare a proposal for management of the previous IANA functions within the multistakeholder model of internet governance including among other considerations the following criteria 

 

(a) protection of the root zone from political or other improper interference;

 

(b) integrity stability continuity security and robustness of the administration of the root zone;

 

(c) widespread [international] trust by Internet users in the administration of this function;

 

(d) support of a single unified root zone; and

 

(e) agreement regarding an accountability mechanism for this function that is broadly accepted as being in the global public interest "

 

2 Preparation of the proposal should involve discussion with all major stakeholder groups with a completion timetable for a first draft for discussion at the Internet Governance Forum in Turkey in September 2014 

 

3 To expedite completion in a timely manner it is suggested that outside consultants be engaged to prepare the discussion paper (proposal) in consultation with major stakeholders 

 

4 The solution must have the following characteristics

 

(a) offers a legal structure that is robust against rogue litigation attacks

 

(b) is aligned with the Internet technical infrastructure in a way that supports innovative technology based evolution of the DNS  

 

(c) is an inclusive model

 

(d) is a demonstrable improvement on current processes in this area

 

 

Background – this document was prepared by Ian Peter (civil society) with inputs from many participants in 1net and Internet Governance Caucus including technical community private sector and civil society representatives with informal inputs from various government representatives It synthesises these inputs to create an achievable pragmatic path forward on this issue which utilises multistakeholder collaboration and will result in greater operational efficiencies for these functions
The undersigned civil society organisations and individuals are pleased to contribute the following submission to the discussion of Internet governance principles at the April 2014 Brazil NETmundial meeting 

 

We are pleased to note the NETmundial organisers  clear focus on human rights particularly as this submission specifically addresses the imperative of adopting a human rights based approach to Internet governance both in terms of 1) providing a framing for Internet governance policy discussions deliberations and decision-making generally and 2) providing principles-based underpinnings to the governance processes and participation mechanisms themselves 

 

The fundamental importance of human rights to Internet governance is broadly understood and accepted but does necessitate further elaboration and greater commitment from all stakeholders – it is all too easy to state that policies and mechanisms are human rights respecting but lip-service is not enough Human rights must be core to Internet governance and we must be explicit in terms of what that actually means 

 

This submission links to two sets of existing and recognized principles that directly address human rights and the Internet 

 

    The Internet Rights and Principles Coalition Charter of human rights and principles for the Internet (IRP Charter)
    And the Association for Progressive Communications (APC) Internet Rights Charter

 

The Internet is an enabler and catalyst of human rights As is stated in APC s Charter the ability to share information and communicate freely using the internet is vital to the realisation of human rights as enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (1948) the International Covenant on Economic Social and Cultural Rights (1976) the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (1976) and the Convention of the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW 1980) 

 

The Internet can only be a catalyst of human rights if the principles that frame and underpin the governance of the Internet are based on human rights The importance of human rights based Internet governance is clearly stated in the IRP Charter of Human Rights and Principles for the Internet The Internet and the communications system must be governed in such a way as to ensure that it upholds and expands human rights to the fullest extent possible 

 

Both the IRP Charter and the APC Charter look specifically at the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) and elaborate on how its articles relate to the Internet and its use and governance For example both Charters look at Article 12 of the UDHR on the right to privacy and elaborate on what that means for the Internet including the importance of national legal frameworks that are in line with human rights the right to communicate anonymously and to use encryption technologies and the right to communicate free from the threat of arbitrary surveillance and interception 

 

We believe that any discussion of Internet principles or policies must be guided by consistent with and respectful of human rights and the APC and IRP Charters provide a clear and unequivocal assertion of that imperative 

 

The importance of human rights or a human rights framing to Internet governance is supported by a diversity of Internet (governance and policy) principles from a diversity of stakeholder groupings including among others the following 

 

    2011 Council of Europe Declaration by the Committee of Ministers on Internet governance principles Principle 1 – Human rights democracy and the rule of law
    2009 CGI br Principles for the governance and use of the Internet Principle 1 – Freedom privacy and human rights
    2011 G8 Deauville Declaration – Renewed Commitment for Freedom and Democracy Paras 5 II 5 II 9 and II 13

 

Internet governance is also dependent upon the realisation and safeguarding of human rights the freedoms of expression and association are essential to participatory and inclusive governance processes – without the realisation of these rights it is quite possible that such governance processes would not exist While the Internet is a catalyst or enabler of rights it is also dependent upon a rights-based governance model for it to thrive and for its users to be empowered 

 

Internet governance comprises a range of process and participation mechanisms that aspire to be characterized by openness transparency inclusivity and accountability among others These characteristics correlate broadly to existing human rights and in particular those enumerated in Articles 18 19 20 and 21 of the UDHR (and 18 19 22 and 25 of the ICCPR) These characteristics are central to rights-based governance – among others they support individuals and communities voicing their opinions and concerns encourage participation by all interested stakeholders on an equal footing allow for transparent and open decision-making processes and ensure stakeholders are accountable to their communities and for the decisions they take 

 

These governance characteristics are further elaborated on in

 

    APC s Charter Theme 6 on the Governance of the Internet ” which calls for the full involvement of all stakeholders in Internet governance transparency and accessibility a decentralized collaborative and interoperable Internet open architecture and open standards among others; and 
    IRPC s Charter Principle 19 on the Right to Appropriate Social and International Order for the Internet ” which calls for governance that upholds and expands human rights multilingualism and pluralism on the Internet and the right of everyone to participate in the governance of the Internet among others 

 

They are also highlighted in the CGI br s second principle entitled Democratic and collaborative governance  These same principles also characterize the multi-stakeholder model as in the Council of Europe s second principle entitled multi-stakeholder governance” and para 20 of the G8 Deauville Declaration (documents mentioned above) 

 

We believe that these key governance characteristics – openness transparency inclusivity accountability and equitable multistakeholder participation among others – should form the basis of a set of process and participation principles for Internet governance that should be an output of the NETmundial meeting They would then frame and provide a common understanding of the ways in which Internet governance discussions deliberations and decision-making would occur (A separate submission to the NETmundial meeting on the evolution of the Internet governance ecosystem addresses these characteristics in more detail )

 

We strongly believe that the NETmundial meeting should reaffirm the importance of human rights to both 1) Internet governance more broadly (and any associated principles or roadmap for the evolution of the Internet governance ecosystem) and 2) the processes and participation mechanisms that underpin Internet governance 

We trust that this contribution and the linked sets of principles will form a central element in the discussions on Internet governance principles 
Draft roadmap for the further evolution of the internet governance ecosystem
Shortcomings of the current internet governance ecosystem
1 Certain issues that are not adequately addressed in the current system

A variety of internet-related public policy issues are not being adequately addressed in the current internet governance ecosystem A non-exhaustive list of pressing substantive issues that we the undersigned members of civil society believe are not being adequately addressed and that have important global dimensions include 

 

    Universal and affordable high-quality access

    Protection of the right of freedom of expression

    Protection of the right to privacy

    Protection of net neutrality

    Access to knowledge

    Enhancing cultural and linguistic diversity

    Cross-border information flow and jurisdiction

2 Institutional shortcomings of the current system

Institutional shortcomings in the current internet governance ecosystem are at the heart of the existing structural failures to address the substantive issues we list above In our view these are 

    Lack of multi-stakeholder decision-making forums to address certain internet-related public policy issues decisions that affect all stakeholders are being made on an ad hoc or arbitrary basis both by governments and the private sector without proper multistakeholder processes in a way that impacts the rights of users and encroaches on the global and distributed functioning of the internet 

    Lack of clarity and coordination between existing forums While there are multiple forums where issues pertaining to internet governance have been addressed there is a lack of clarity about how and where decisions are made 

    Imbalance of power in existing forums Many people and groups in particular from the global south are marginalised from decision-making processes There is also insufficient diversity of voices including with regards to gender and language diversity 

    Digital development agenda as set out during WSIS has failed to fully deliver The international digital development framework as set out in the Tunis Agenda and the WSIS Action Lines[1] is seen to have done little to address development concerns and the digital divide which remains a pressing issue 

Guiding Principles for Evolving the Internet Governance Ecosystem

We consider the following mutually-supporting criteria to be necessary for the further evolution of the internet governance ecosystem 

a) Underlying Values

    Protection and promotion of Human Rights should be at the core of any governance process and outcomes guided by international human rights legal frameworks as enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) and the International Covenant on Economic Social and Cultural Rights ICESCR)[2] 

    Preservation of the global nature of the internet should be at the core of any internet governance processes Maintaining and advancing the interoperable decentralized open and global nature of the internet should be a priority over the short-term interest of any particular stakeholder group 

    Operationalization of multistakeholder approaches to governance processes recognizing that the role of different stakeholder varies according to the issue venue and status of discussion Sections b) and c) below provide minimum guidelines 

b) Decision making processes

    Transparent and comprehensible it should be possible for anyone to understand how Internet Governance related decision making processes work in the various fora and how decisions are made Institutions should pro-actively publish data information and documents in accessible formats in a timely manner 

    Accountable internal and external accountability processes should exist including a way of challenging decisions;

    Effective decisions should be enforceable and meet the policy goals they were meant to tackle;

    Adaptable able to take account of new innovations and developments in the field and also be able to accommodate new voices 

c) Participation

    Inclusive and open not limited to a small exclusive club but open to many with all necessary points of view included in order to reach good decisions/agreements;

    Informed possessing the necessary expertise to make decisions including reflecting all different geographic regions;

    Meaningful participation anybody affected by a decision should be able to impact upon decision-making processes Ensuring gender and regional balance and the inclusion of marginalized voices are particularly important 

Roadmap for the Further Evolution of the Internet Governance Ecosystem[3]

We outline below a proposal to address the shortcomings of the current system that are consistent with the list of criteria highlighted above These arrangements seek to improve the existing internet governance ecosystem developing and maintaining a distributed coordinated multistakeholder system of internet governance The gradual implementation of this proposal provides a roadmap for the evolution of the Internet Governance Ecosystem 

 

While a centralised system might be easier to navigate a distributed system guided by the principles outlined earlier in this submission addresses far more effectively the shortcomings listed above The internet is not an fixed issue but an evolving space Therefore it is a mistake to think that one body and one set of experts could possibly be responsible for effective policy making on all Internet-related matters Rather a distributed system better enables issue-based expertise including from civil society from around the world to engage on specific issues Therefore the proposals below seek to address the weaknesses and gaps in the current system by strengthening coordinating and improving the existing distributed system of internet governance 

 
1 A new co-ordinating function

In response to the shortcomings underlined above we propose a new coordinating mechanism consistent with paragraph 37 of the Tunis Agenda to facilitate the coherence and effectiveness of existing internet-related policy making mechanisms within a distributed model 

 

This coordination mechanism should include all stakeholders and build on work already done (including within the Correspondence Group of the Working Group on Enhanced Cooperation) to seek compile review research and analyze inputs on progress and gaps in international Internet related public policy Based on this work it shall also recommend the most appropriate venue or venues to develop further policy as required 

 

It could [be newly established or] attached to an existing multistakeholder body such the IGF (per paragraph 72 b of the Tunis Agenda) to the UN Commission on Science and Technology for Development (CSTD) or to any comparable venue consistent with the guiding principles outlined earlier in this submission 

 
2 Issue-specific multistakeholder working groups

For some specific issues[4] that are not being adequately addressed in the current framework we propose that these should be resolved through ad hoc multi-stakeholder working groups developed on a case by case basis bringing together relevant actors The above-mentioned co-ordinating function would aid stakeholders in identifying gaps in the current framework so that ad hoc working groups would only be formed when there is an actual need and help forge collaboration between existing institutions and disband once the issue is addressed 

 

These groups could but not necessarily work within the IGF framework or through flexible open and inclusive processes and that are consistent with the guiding principles outlined above Innovative methodologies of broad consultation and participation could be looked into as alternatives when necessary 

 
3 Broad participation & role of reformed IGF

While the coordination function can be responsible for designating the venue or venues where issues that are not adequately addressed will be taken forward the IGF should continue to function as a platform where ongoing policy processes and their outcomes are presented and can receive feedback from a wider audience 

 

The lGF process of the last five years has enriched our understanding of internet public policy issues actors spaces and challenges Therefore we view a reformed IGF that at minimum implements the recommendations of the Working Group on IGF Improvements as playing a central role for a space where problems are framed and principles are developed In addition to the recommendations of that report we also point to a series of concrete recommendations previously proposed by members of civil society including new approaches to IGF themes session formats reforming the Multistakeholder Advisory Group (MAG) funding and online deliberation mechanisms [5]

Introduction

On 23-24 April 2014 the Global Multistakeholder Meeting on the Future of Internet Governance (NETmundial 2014) will meet in Brazil to discuss a roadmap for the further evolution of the governance ecosystem This submission deals with the place of the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) in this ecosystem 

 

Whilst ICANN has indicated on several occasions that it solely focuses on the technical administration of the Domain Name System (DNS) and the coordination of the IP address space it is simply impossible to ignore the broader public policy dimensions of its work This includes among other things intellectual property competition and taxation policy In particular ICANN defines and enforces intellectual property rules regarding rights in domain names which inevitably has a highly significant impact on the ability of internet users to access information and therefore the meaningful exercise of the right to freedom of expression 

 

Over the years however several concerns have been raised about ICANN s legitimacy in taking policy decisions in certain areas due to its corporate governance arrangements in particular 

 

    The lack of independence from the US government as regards the IANA function;

    The lack of representation of developing countries within ICANN;

    The disproportionate  influence of the Government Advisory Committee (GAC);

    The lack of accountability of the Board 

In this submission ARTICLE 19 and the undersigned organisations offer some recommendations with a view to improving ICANN s current governance structure and accountability as well strengthening the protection of human rights within ICANN We believe that reform of ICANN is inevitable if it is to fulfil its promise as a truly global multistakeholder organisation In order to succeed we believe that any reform of ICANN should be guided by the following principles 

    Multistakeholder not multilateral

    Human Rights in particular the rights to free expression privacy and due process 

    Transparency & Accountability

    Inclusiveness & Diversity

We elaborate on what this means in practice further below It is hoped that our submission will prove valuable for the safeguard of the multistakeholder model of Internet Governance 

 
A ICANN s legal status

We believe that in order to both ensure ICANN s independence and protect it from the disproportionate influence of governments ICANN s nongovernmental status should be affirmed and formalised By the same token it would allow for ICANN s nature as a multistakeholder organisation to be both maintained and strengthened 

 

For the same reason we would oppose turning ICANN into an international inter-governmental organisation which would make the organisation subordinate to the interests of Member States 

 
B Mandate

Although ICANN s foray in content regulation has been very limited so far (see for instance  xxx controversy) we are concerned that its policy-making powers could in principle allow it to engage in these kinds of activities to a greater degree We therefore recommend that ICANN s mandate should be clarified and narrowed for example by 

 

    Introducing a provision in ICANN s bylaws prohibiting the organisations from engaging in content regulation or conduct that would violate the rights to freedom of expression or privacy 

    Introducing in ICANN s bylaws a right of private parties to initiate legal challenges to ICANN actions on these grounds which could be taken before the local courts or in exceptional circumstances before an arbitration tribunal 

    The resolution of trademark and other Intellectual Property disputes should duly take into account the right to freedom of expression and the right to culture as laid down in international instruments such as the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the International Covenant on Economic Social and Cultural Rights 

C Location / Applicable law

To the extent that ICANN should remain a non-profit public benefit corporate organisation  Californian law would appear suitable 

However in line with the President s Strategy Committee (PSC) s 2009 report it may be desirable for ICANN to delegate some of its functions to subsidiaries that would be located elsewhere 

There are a number of advantages to ICANN not moving its headquarters outside the US 

    it would ensure the stability of current contractual arrangements with registries registrars etc ;

    there would be no need to negotiate with the USG;

     it would not prevent ICANN from expanding its reach beyond the US To a certain extent that has already taken place through the creation of various hub and engagement offices around the world 

Ultimately the question whether ICANN should create subsidiaries outside the US is very much an operational decision involving numerous parameters that is beyond the scope of the present document 

Finally it is worth noting that the PSC 2009 report  suggested that Switzerland and Belgium might offer suitable solutions for ICANN to pursue its objective of international expansion If for example ICANN were to decide to open a subsidiary in Switzerland an interesting question might be whether the IANA function or one aspect of it could be delegated to that entity 

 
D Denationalise the IANA contract

Acceptable solutions for assignment of the IANA root zone function should meet several criteria (1) protection of the root zone from political or other improper interference; (2) integrity stability continuity security and robustness of the administration of the root zone; (3) widespread trust by Internet users in the administration of this function; (4) support of a single unified root zone; and (5) agreement regarding an accountability mechanism for this function that is broadly accepted as being in the global public interest 

 

In order to protect the rootzone from political interference we believe that multi-lateralisation of the IANA contract should be avoided Rather to the extent that it is functionally feasible we believe that the IANA function should be delegated to different private entities along the lines suggested by the IGP For instance there is no reason in principle why the IANA functions should be concentrated in ICANN which already performs a wide range of functions Greater effectiveness and accountability are more likely to be achieved through a distributed model of governance here 

 
E Improved representation and participation of developing countries

    This should take place both within ICANN generally and the GAC specifically 

    Sufficient fund should be allocated to this end for instance by redirecting some of the revenues from gTLD domain name registrations to developing countries 

    In line with the Accountability and Transparency Review Team 2 (ATRT2) recommendations ICANN should translate all its working documents policy minutes of meetings in the UN official languages 

F Making the GAC more inclusive transparent and accountable

    Following the recommendations of the ATRT 1 and 2 GAC s proceedings  should be made open to other stakeholders to observe and participate as appropriate This could possibly be accomplished through the participation of liaisons from other Advisory Committees and Supporting Organisations to the GAC once that mechanism has been agreed upon and implemented;

    The GAC s working methods should be made more transparent along the lines recommended by the ATRT 1 and 2;

    There is no reason in principle why GAC s advice should be given more weight than that of other advisory committees The same privilege should be extended to the other advisory groups e g ALAC and SSAC by amending ICANN s bylaws accordingly More generally the GAC should be on a equal footing with the other advisory committees;

    Granting any additional powers to the GAC should be firmly resisted including the delegation of ccTLDs to governments Whilst this may seem as naturally falling within states  jurisdictions it carries with it high risks for the right to freedom of expression if used as a means to control content;

    Consideration should be given to mainstreaming government representatives participation within supporting organisations in particular the Generic Name Supporting Organisation A working group could be put in place to that effect 

G Accountability of the Board

    The decision-making process of the Board should be made more transparent in line with ATRT2 recommendations including the giving of reasons for its decisions;

    The Independent Review of Board Actions should be strengthened At a minimum the Independent Review Process Panel s decisions should be both binding and contain reasons which should be made public as a matter of principle;

    There should be a possibility to call for dissolution of the Board in exceptional circumstances;

    If ICANN s status as a private organisation is to be retained consideration should be given to broadening the scope of the issues that can be taken up before the local courts in particular issues relating to the right to freedom of expression Another possibility would be to include a unilateral option clause that would enable a choice between the local courts or arbitration proceedings 

Conclusion

For ICANN s reform to be successful it is vital for the private sector civil society governments and users to be engaged in conversations about Internet Governance because of their inherent value for innovation protection of rights stability and security We hope that the above proposal will help stimulate discussion about reform of ICANN 
Towards a Just and Equitable Internet for All

The Just Net Coalition was formed at a meeting in Delhi in February 2014 It comprises several dozen organisations and individuals from different global regions concerned with internet governance human rights and social justice and the relationship between them 

---------------

The Internet has become a vitally important social infrastructure that profoundly impacts our societies  We are all citizens of an Internet-mediated world whether as the minority who uses it or the majority who does not  The Internet must advance human rights and social justice  Internet governance must be truly democratic 

 

The Internet is reorganising public institutions including for governance welfare health and education as well as key sectors such as media communications transport and finance It has transformed the way we do many things but the benefits promised for all have not been adequately realized On the contrary - we have seen mass surveillance abusive use of personal data and their use as a means of social and political control; the monopolization commodification and monetisation of information and knowledge; inequitable flows of finances between poor and rich countries; and erosion of cultural diversity  Many technical and thus purportedly  neutral  decisions have in reality led to social injustice as technology architectures often developed to promote vested interests increasingly determine social economic cultural and political relationships and processes 

 

Opportunities for the many to participate in the very real benefits of the Internet and to fully realize its enormous potential are being thwarted by growing control of the Internet by those with power - large corporations and certain national governments They use their central positions of influence to consolidate power and to establish a new global regime of control and exploitation; under the guise of favouring liberalization they are in reality reinforcing the dominance and profitability of major corporations at the expense of the public interest and the overarching position of some national interests at the expense of global interests and well being 

 

Existing governance arrangements for the global Internet are inadequate They suffer from a lack of democracy; an absence of legitimacy accountability and transparency; excessive corporate influence and regulatory capture; and too few opportunities for effective participation by people especially from developing countries  The situation can be remedied only through fundamental changes to the current governance arrangements 

 

The governance of the Internet must proceed from the position that inter-connectivity cannot serve human rights and social justice unless it leads to and supports distributed power particularly to the grassroots but also across the various Internet divides—social economic political Ensuring that the Internet does not in fact lead to greater centralisation of power will therefore require appropriate interventions at all levels of Internet governance Building an effective framework to achieve these objectives is the greatest challenge today in terms of global governance of the Internet 

 

In this light we put forward the following principles These should underpin the emergence of an Internet that advances human rights and social justice globally and the reconfiguration of Internet governance into a truly democratic space 

 

 The Internet as a Global Commons for Human Rights and Social Justice 

 

 1      The Internet is a key social medium and in crucial respects a global commons it isa site for global knowledge and information exchange a space for free expression and association a means for democratic deliberation and participation a channel for delivery of essential social and public services and a scaffold for new models of economic activity Therefore all the world s people including those not at present connected to the Internet must be able to collaboratively shape the evolution of the Internetthrough appropriately transparent democratic and participatory governance processes 

 

2       The Internet must be used only for peaceful purposes and this must be recognised by states in a binding and enforceable instrument 

 

3       The Internet economy like other areas of the global economy must be subject to fair and equitable collection and distribution of tax revenues around the world recognising that the concentration of global North based international e-commerce is a threat to the tax revenues of the global South 

 

4       The Internet must be maintained as a public space Where a divergence emerges between the utility of the Internet for public interest purposes and the particular interests of Internet service or technology companies the public interest must take priority and the service must be subjected to regulation as a public utility 

 

5       Net neutrality and similar  platform neutrality  in higher layers of the Internet must be ensured in order to preserve online diversity and to prevent monopolies in either content or in the provision of essential public services in mobile as well as fixed network architectures 

 

6       An open and decentralized Internet requires strict enforcement of open and public standards Open standards allow fully interoperable implementation by anyone in any type of software including Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) The trend towards privatisation of digital standards must be stemmed and measures must be introduced to ensure that standards are publicly owned freely accessible and implementable 

 

7      The architecture for cloud computing should enhance digital functionality and efficiencies without reducing user control and choices It should also enable users to have adequate legal protections either through domestic jurisdictions or effective international agreements 

 

8      The Internet s basic or essential functionalities and services such as email web search facilities and social networking platforms must be made available to all people as public goods 

 

9      People must be able to enjoy all their rights and entitlements as citizens even if they choose not to have Internet access Access to and use of the Internet should not become a requirement for access to public services 

 

 10    Community-owned and not-for-profit infrastructure applications services and content must be encouraged and enabled including through access to public funding and by other means 

 

11   The right to access and contribute to the development of the Internet including its content particularly of marginalised and/or minority groups is essential to maintaining cultural and linguistic diversity and must be secured through protective discrimination and affirmative action 

 

12    Personal and social data must belong respectively to the relevant individual and social group Policy frameworks for operationalising such effective control and ownership of digital data must be developed 

 

A Rights Framework for truly Democratic Governance of the Internet

 

13    The Internet must be governed recognising that in crucial respects it comprises a global commons All layers of Internet architecture must therefore be designed to safeguard against concentration of power and centralized control 

 

14    All people have the right to freedom of expression online Any restrictions on grounds of security concerns or otherwise must be for strictly defined purposes and in accordance with globally accepted principles of necessity proportionality and judicial oversight 

 

15    All people must have the right to use the Internet without mass surveillance Any surveillance on grounds of security concerns or otherwise must be for strictly defined purposes and in accordance with globally accepted principles of necessity proportionality and judicial oversight 

 

16    At the global level there is a severe democratic deficit in Internet governance Appropriate platforms and mechanisms for global governance of the Internet that are democratic and participative must be established urgently These must be anchored to the UN system and include explicit provisions to design and enable innovative methods for ongoing and deep participation of non-governmental actors in policy making processes Participating non-governmental actors must in turn be subject to appropriate transparency requirements in particular regarding sources of funding membership and decision-making processes 

 

17    The right to make Internet-related public policies must lie only with those who legitimately and directly represent people While there is a pressing need to deepen democracy through innovative methods of participatory democracy these cannot include – in the name of multi-stakeholderism – new kinds of formal political power for corporate or partisan interests 

 

18    Governance systems must be based on the recognition that the Internet has an impact on society that the technical community with its singular focus on technical issues lacks the legitimacy to determine 

 

19    The laws of any one country or one group of countries cannot control or constitute international technical and public policy governance structures Management of critical resources of the Internet must be internationalised Current control by the US of the DNS/root zone must thus be replaced by a new transparent accountable and internationally representative institution responsible for the oversight of critical Internet resource management functions 

 

20  Every country must have the right to connect to the Internet No country can have the unilateral ability to disconnect another country or a region from the Internet 

 

21  The rights of individuals and states must be articulated and protected with regard to the Internet including through the creation of appropriate enforcement mechanisms Such mechanisms are required at both the domestic and international levels and should include dispute resolution mechanisms 

Issues  statement

Strong asymmetries exist in the standards of accountability and transparency of Internet policy and of operational and technical bodies closer to user access at regional and national level 
Is there a forum or Internet Governance body that develops policy or technical outcomes involved in these issues 

Some I* (i-star) members have developed such policies although as a group it does not uphold to common explicit public standards as a whole Only some of its members benefit from explicit governance rules Civil society and Governments are impacted by this issue as some entities at the local level are directly involved in the business to provide access or some of its elements 

 
If there is how and why are these issues not being adequately dealt with by that forum ororganization 

RIR IXPs ccTLDs and gTLDs are not subject to the same level of accountability and transparency as other higher level entities Policy makers have less influence and less understanding of their business procedures which are most familiar to private sector access providers This situation can lead to stronger friction at the regional and local levels and if uncoordinated may negatively impact the path to globalization to IG 
What are the possible responses to the challenges posed by these issues 

The drive to globalization must be accompanied by regulated and equal accountability and transparency standards at the regional and national level to avoid the risk that domestic may not be sufficiently empowered to be correctly implemented This risk is substantially higher in the case that the less technical-oriented and non-commercial stakeholders are left behind This situation does not comply with the standards of subsidiarity proposed by The ICANN Strategy Panel on Multistakeholder Innovation which speaks of subsidiary and decentralized Accountability at national level in order to allow all local stakeholders to have a common solution and represent common national and regional positions at the global level 

 
How will the possible responses proposed ensure the stability resilience and efficiency and also comply with principles of equitable multistakeholder participation accountability transparency and predictability 

 

New global Internet governance architectures should guarantee the same accountability and transparency standards to entities that operate either at the regional or at local levels Moreover to help avoid asymmetries in access and governance at local level in smaller economies a proactive stance should be taken to promote and guarantee true bottom-up multi-stakeholder participation in all relevant issues 

 
Background

• The Internet developed thanks to open and transparent collaboration between very bright people that have changed not only the way we communicate but also the way we develop policy and govern the entities which run the networks necessary for today s society 

 

• The Internet operates today in an ecosystem of international regional and local entities each one with its own role and objectives of which I* is the most important group of technical entities 

 

• However not all entities are equally accessible to Governments and civil society stakeholders in terms of representation accountability and transparency of their policy making as well as their governance models 

 

• As a new path to the globalization of Internet Governance is being discussed it is important that all stakeholders particularly non-technical ones develop the same degree of trust towards all entities of the ecosystem independently how far or how close to their particular immediate needs 

 

• To ensure real bottom-up involvement of all stakeholders the involvement of regional and local level actors must be taken into consideration as well as the actors that affect users Internet experience directly Those have to be able to participate from their local standpoint in a consistent bottom-up multi-stakeholder model approach 

 
Accountability and transparency of the I* entities at the higher level

 

• As Internet developed it also grew wider involving more and more stakeholders Governments and civil society has been increasingly involved in the international fora and entities like IGF ICANN and IETF over the last few years 

 

• I* entities have been traditionally very open to all stakeholders although its output has been traditionally dominated by the technical community from the more developed countries 

 

• As Internet became more commercial over the last decade the definition and scope of action of different stakeholders became more clear and structured (ex GAC)

 

• In order to clearly develop ICANN as a separate entity from the USG explicit rules of accountability and transparency along with new governance mechanisms were built into the oversight of its very relevant technical function (AoC)

 

• As the system expands further involvement of private actors with the new gTLDs is expected to bring about more competition in the provision of internet services worldwide to the benefit of consumers

 

• However down the value chain as regional and local entities create business with private operators and service providers they can no longer claim that they have a purely technical role and thus avoid open governance rules existent higher up 

 

• If civil society can only participate at the higher level of policy making it will be difficult to provide evidence of direct relationship between this level and the local conditions of most users In the case of governments of smaller countries the coalitions can be very difficult as they have little technical expertise to be able to participate consistently in so many international entities and their working groups

 

• Worst of all lack of local capacity in terms of ICT for development can turn into bad policy decisions and create expectations on the globalization of the Internet that cannot be met as shown recently by the WCIT12 

 
Multi-stakeholder participation at regional and local levels

 

• As the internet grows in geographic outreach and number of users its regional entities (RIRs IXPs ccTLDs and eventually the new gTLDs in other alphabets) have not followed in terms of engaging the bottom-up multi-stakeholder model which gives equal opportunities to less technical and less commercial interests 

 

• Their role is very relevant to local stakeholders as those entities are in permanent interaction with the mostly private entities that offer access to the Internet and that impact the terms conditions coverage quality and privacy terms in which people connect The simple PSTN regulation of the telecom infrastructure that carries the Internet is not a viable alternative to solve those issues in the best interest of the wider public 

 

• While it is also true that the role of these regional entities is more operational and less linked to policy-making Governments and the civil society may develop higher expectations in finding solutions to local bottlenecks especially as Internet reaches out to more users While not responsible for all of these obstacles if there is no greater level of engagement between the local stakeholders some of the problems may just bump up the ladder making international issues even more complex 

 

• Finally as regional and local entities open up to their local constituencies they can better translate local issues to the global system If well-coordinated these entities along with local governments and civil society could very well play a larger role than today in the Governance of the future global architecture 

 
Roadmap to the globalization of the Internet

 

Today not all I* entities follow the same explicit rules for accountability and transparency in their policy-making and governance This implies different chances for the less technical and less commercial stakeholders to participate actively in their policy-making and operations While many stakeholders have found adequate space in specific constituencies in ICANN and at the IGF to make their voices heard there is paradoxically less opportunity for them to participate at regional and country levels in entities closer to implementations operational and private sector issues Moreover there are large differences in the standard expected from ccTLDs as compared to gTLDs 

 

Only a few large countries have the scope and scale to organize their own internal multistakeholder organization such as Brazil (cgi br) While some meetings where RIRs and ccTLDs participate are also open they are much more technical and business oriented and lack formal accountability and transparency mechanisms making it difficult for less technical stakeholders to follow up on their operations Less resources are available for participation of the civil society at regional level than at global levels Last but not least smaller countries have little weight in those regional organizations due to their limited markets However it is those smaller economies that suffer from serious bottlenecks and high costs of Internet access due to many different conditions and limited scale 

 

While ICANN strategic panels have already recognized the need to apply governance principles more consistently particularly in terms of participation [1] revision of policy and operational decisions [2] and subsidiarity [3] other I* entities are farther away from offering those conditions to governments of smaller countries and to civil society groups from those countries Our recommendation is that NET mundial Roadmap to Globalization include the need for consistent application of explicit principles and standards particularly in terms of accountability and transparency of operations policy development and governance of all internet entities at all geographic levels so that all entities can comply with the same high standards and enjoy legitimacy in the eyes of all local stakeholders By opening up to more transparency and responsibilities at their local levels they may very well play a larger role in the future in the Governance of the new global architecture

1) Internet Governance Principles

 

ISOC-Yemen and ISOC-BD welcome the opportunity to participate in the Global Multistakeholder Meeting on the Future of Internet Governance  As organizations concerned with expanding Internet access and promoting a strong open and resilient Internet we rely on an open stable secure resilient and interoperable Internet every day  We believe that preserving the multistakeholder model of Internet governance is essential to ensuring that global citizens are able to take advantage of this transformative platform both now and in the future 

 

Below we highlight some high level principles for Internet governance going forward  We believe that these principles will both allow the global Internet community to preserve the open Internet for the billions who currently rely on it in their daily lives and bring its advantages to the 5 billion people who are presently unconnected 

 

Substantive Principles Any Model of Internet Governance Should Promote the Following Principles 

 

  The world deserves the access to knowledge services commerce and communication the accompanying benefits to economic development education and health care and the informed discussion that the Internet provides  Governance should promote expanding access to broadband networks so that these benefits can reach all of the world s citizens          

 

  The Internet s importance as a platform for commerce for education for information and knowledge sharing for self-expression and for organization and assembly depends on the global free flow of information  Any model for governance must promote this free flow of information 

 

  Governance should promote the ability to innovate to develop technical capacity and to create and take advantage of economic opportunities  To achieve this end any model of Internet governance must promote the open distributed interoperable and interconnected nature of the Internet 

 

  Because the Internet is an integral part of the global economy its security stability and resiliency must be preserved 

 

  Individuals should be able to exercise their human rights both online and offline 

 

  Governments should recognize limitations on their ability to collect information on Internet users based on users  reasonable privacy interests and the impact on trust in the Internet 

 

Governance Principles Any Model of Internet Governance Should Have the Following Characteristics 

 

  All stakeholders -- individual users governments civil society businesses and members of the academic and technical community -- have a stake in preserving the Internet as a critical platform for communication and information exchange and therefore all stakeholders should be included in governance decisions  All of these stakeholders have contributed to the development of the Internet to date and working together they have driven unprecedented growth in access to uses of and innovation on the Internet  They must continue to be involved in any future model of Internet governance 

 

  Any policy-making associated with the Internet must promote openness transparency and accountability and must be grounded in respect for the rule of law 

 

 

2) Roadmap for the Further Evolution of the Internet Governance Ecosystem

 

 

Introduction

 

ISOC-Yemen and ISOC-BD thank the Brazilian government CGI br and the Executive Multistakeholder Committee for the opportunity to participate in the Global Multistakeholder Meeting on the Future of Internet Governance  The Internet and the World Wide Web have generated an unprecedented explosion in commerce and creativity  According to a May 2011 study by the McKinsey Global Institute (“Internet Matters The net s sweeping impact on growth jobs and prosperity”) nearly eight trillion dollars of online commerce occurs each year through e-commerce  The same report states that the Internet accounts for 21 percent of gross domestic product growth in the last five years in mature countries and that the benefits are not reserved for Internet companies – in fact 75 percent of Internet economic impact benefits companies that are not pure Internet players 

 

A March 2012 report by the Boston Consulting Group – entitled The Internet Economy in the G-20  The $4 2 Trillion Growth Opportunity” – provides policy makers more data about the impact of the Internet on economic growth and job creation  According to the report Internet-savvy small- and medium-sized enterprises (SME) across eleven of the G-20 countries have experienced 22 percent higher revenue growth over the last three years than comparable businesses with no Internet usage  The report also found that SMEs that have an Internet presence generate more jobs  In Germany for example 93 percent of companies that were heavy users of the Internet and web services increased employment over the past three years compared with only 50 percent of their offline competitors 

 

Despite the significant positive impact of the Internet on the world s economy this transformative technology stands at a crossroads  Some governments want to replace the existing multi-stakeholder model of Internet governance through which governments civil society industry the engineering community and users all recognize a shared responsibility and role in the continued advancement of the Internet  These governments instead are advancing a regulatory approach that strengthens their role at the expense of other stakeholders -- effectively excluding those who have conceptualized built operated and contributed to the Internet s success 

 

The entire Internet community -- including governments businesses civil society academic and technical experts and individual users -- must continue working together if we want the Internet to remain an open vibrant platform for innovation growth and the free exchange of ideas and if we want to expand the reach of this technology to those who remain unconnected 

 

Issue Statement

 

In recent years some governments have argued that a multilateral rather than a multistakeholder model for Internet governance would better serve public policy objectives   The multi-stakeholder model approach to Internet governance and technical management has allowed the Internet to grow and flourish into the critical global platform it is today and we believe it will continue to best serve Internet users far into the future 

 

However there are two main challenges before us  The first challenge is ensuring the Internet governance model continues to evolve in a manner that allows all stakeholders to have a voice in critical policy discussions  The Internet is expected to serve 90-95% of the world s population by 2030  Uses of the Internet continue to grow and diversify 

 

Second all actors have a common interest in the security stability and interoperability of the overall infrastructure  However no one actor or organization has the capacity to address all of the various public policy and technical issues impacting the Internet and its users  Further to this point Internet technology and the ways in which people use the is advancing at such a rapid pace that any regulation imposed on the system would never be able to keep up and remaining effective over the long term This means the rubric of organizations that currently make up the Internet governance process are both multifaceted and narrow in mission and scope and also nimble in order to meet both the demands of today and the needs of tomorrow  Therefore no one organization can address or should address every concern related to global Internet policy  While this arrangement creates resiliency and brings needed expertise to any decision it can be confusing to navigate  Therefore the current governance structure could do a better job in assisting stakeholders in navigating the various organizations and entities that address particular issues 

 

Existing Internet Governance Bodies or Fora Tackling These Issues

 

Because Internet governance is multifaceted -- spanning technical political and policy issues -- there is no single organization that manages or has jurisdiction over all Internet governance questions; instead the Internet s policies and protocols have rapidly evolved through a set of diverse organizations  Together a robust set of multistakeholder Internet institutions each with different core functions and strengths address nearly all Internet policy and technical issues 

 

A few such examples include 

 

  The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) which develops global standards and protocols;

 

  The Internet Corporation for the Assignment of Names and Numbers (ICANN) which manages the global system for Internet naming numbering and addressing;

 

  The Internet Governance Forum (IGF) which brings together academia governments civil society and industry as a means of fostering the discussion or critical Internet issues; and

 

  The Internet Society (ISOC) to which we as chapters are affiliate a technical organization which seeks to promote the open development evolution and use of the Internet for the benefit of all people throughout the world 

 

The above are a few examples of the high-level organizations whose missions cover a wide range of technical and policy issues; however because of the Internet governance process  inherent flexibility it is able to adapt to the changing Internet environment  In several situations issue-specific organizations have developed over time to address key Internet issues  A few examples include 

 

  The Messaging Malware and Mobile Anti-Abuse Working Group (MAAWG) which is a global member-driven organization that works collaboratively to address various forms of messaging abuse (such as spam viruses denial-of-service attacks and other messaging exploitations) through industry collaboration technology and public policy initiatives;

 

  The Forum for Incident Response and Security Teams (FIRST) which brings together a variety of computer security incident response teams from government commercial and educational organizations and aims to foster cooperation and coordination in incident prevention to stimulate rapid reaction to incidents and to promote information sharing among members and the community at-large; and

 

  Global Computer Incident Response Teams (CERTs) which are global organizations responsible for leading efforts to improve cybersecurity online coordinate cyber information sharing and proactively manage cyber risks 

 

When a cyber incident occurs it often happens in real time and across borders and the response needs to be coordinated and immediate which is why the inherent flexibility within the Internet governance process is so critical  The attacks may be sophisticated and require special subject-matter expertise to understand and counter  Global cybersecurity mandates imposed through governments are not an effective response to the dynamic threats posed by cyberattacks  Cybersecurity attacks such as the Conficker Botnet or the Stuxnet Virus required private sector actors academic researchers governments and NGOs to work together in close coordination to combat these attacks 

 

As Internet policy discussions become more global in nature we believe stakeholders should continue to rely on the existing structures to develop global policies that benefit all users rather than relying on either the creation of another governance body or on multilateral means 

 

Areas for Improvement

 

As is demonstrated above there are numerous organizations that manage Internet policy and technical issues  The Internet community does not lack for places to discuss key Internet policy and governance questions  Rather a critical concern voiced by some stakeholders is that the rubric of organizations and overlapping missions is confusing and difficult to navigate without considerable time and effort  While these concerns are valid they do not necessarily counsel in favor of directing all Internet policy discussions into one body  Rather we must find a way to take advantage of the richness of the ecosystem while making it easier to navigate especially for new entrants 

 

In that vein we believe the definition of Internet governance that was coined in 2005 at the close of the World Summit on the Information Society (WSIS) in the Tunis Agenda is important to note 

 

Internet governance is the development and application by Governments the private sector and civil society in their respective roles of shared principles norms rules decision-making procedures and programmes that shape the evolution and use of the Internet 

 

This definition endorsed at the time by more than 180 governments set the path for how stakeholders can engage in the Internet governance process  The cornerstones of the Tunis Agenda mirror the decentralized open and collaborative nature of the Internet itself 

 

  Multilateral There is no single entity in charge” of Internet governance Instead governments industry and civil society work together 

 

  Transparent Policy processes should be open and clearly articulated to all 

 

  Democratic The development of Internet governance arrangements should enable full and equal participation of all stakeholders Unlike traditional intergovernmental processes that put strict limits on what can be on the agenda Internet governance issues are raised from the bottom-up and solved through self-organizing consensus-driven arrangements 

 

It is incumbent on participants within the current governance model to bring new stakeholders whose voices may not be effectively heard into the conversation 

 

  Increased outreach capacity building and training for regulators  While many if not all of the technical meetings are inclusive of all participants the majority of the meetings historically have taken place in the developed world and their processes can be difficult to grasp as a newcomer  We applaud recent efforts undertaken by the IETF and ISOC at increasing the global reach of their meetings as well as offering fellowships to engineers and policymakers from the developing world  We would support similar efforts in this space in other fora as these present important opportunities to engage thought leaders globally 

 

  Increase and diversify newcomer sessions  International organizations should make it easier for newer participants to meaningfully engage in their processes  To do this these organizations should offer training and newcomer sessions both at their physical meetings and remotely as a means of introducing more people to the organizations and encouraging them to participate in critical Internet governance debates 

 

  Improve transparency and accountability  Multilateral organizations whose missions touch the Internet (e g UNESCO OECD UN and ITU) should provide better transparency and accountability in their decision-making processes and how the overall decisions impact the Internet All Internet governance institutions should strive to make relevant governance and policy documents available to all stakeholders at no cost Participation in board and governance meetings of Internet governance organizations should be open whenever possible  For many participants it is difficult and often cost-prohibitive to attend meetings in person  For that reason Internet governance institutions should strive to improve remote participation opportunities 

 

How These Improvements Address the Noted Concerns

 

The suggestions above would serve three principal goals 

 

  They will make the existing Internet governance institutions more accessible to new participants 

 

  They will help all stakeholders in navigating the complex interplay between the various organizations that have a role in Internet governance

 

  They will help ensure that all Internet governance institutions operate transparently and openly facilitating meaningful participation and accountability to all stakeholders 

 

Conclusion

 

 

We believe that the existing system of governance for the Internet is effective and inclusive and for this reason it should continue to be improved and reinforced This bottom-up process dates back to the beginnings of the Internet whose founders believed that openness would be more secure and encourage innovation The Internet governance model allows for the representation of all stakeholders - governments engineers businesses academics and civil society – and ensures all participants to have a voice in the continued evolution and growth of the Internet 

 

Walid Al-Saqaf of ISOC-Yemen & Jahangir Hossain of ISOC-BD

One of the first principles of Internet governance is the democratic principle as it contains within its aspirations the fulfillment of the human rights  based principles  There are few who would argue against the principle that Internet governance ought to be democratic There is some disagreement however on whether the multistakeholder model currently being used represents a way forward for democracy and whether it fulfills the democratic principle that is central to our discussions 

 

One of the most common complaints against the Multistakeholder approach is the it by-passes the democratically elected representives of the people  Often when one is sitting with governments one hears a statement of the form 

 

 We do not know what Multistakeholder means but we all know what Democracy means”

 

Among those who consider themselves democratic each with its own definition of democracy we find 

 

    People s Democracy

 

    Autocracy 2 0

 

    Constitutional monarchies

 

    Parliamentary republics

 

    Presidential multi-partite republics

 

    Majority based  one man one vote  democracy

 

    Democracy that incorporates minority rights in the voting

 

    Democracy that impedes minority rights in the voting

 

    Democracy that balances national religious membership

 

    Plebiscite based direct democracy

 

Since the time of Aristotle we have been arguing about Democracy and invoking its name for all sorts of systems where the people or at least some people have some say in their governance regime; at least some of the time  Even Athens was democratic at least for males born in Athens  

 

When we look at the most basic form of multilateral expressions of democracy we find that the ‘one person  one vote  is more an ideal than a reality where nations with a population of tens of thousands have the same vote as those with a population of over a billion  Yet we view the UN as representing a form of democracy We have seen that in many cases multilateral democracy does not serve the multivariate interests of the people - it is focused on the notion of states as entities and it is out of scope to discuss the needs of people within a country  The muultilateral systems has showj itself to be inadequate for handling the needs of the Internet whether it was the creation of the protocols and other technology that created the Internet or the issues and policy questions that resulted from the behaviors on the Internet  This is becasue the issues are too complex for any one grouping including a global multilateral grouping to handle 

 

The question comes down to what we mean by democracy on the Internet   

 

When we speak of  democracy especially with regard to the Internet we need to develop ever improved forms of participatory democracy  Participatory democracy is an advance in democracy that has seen few examples in the world to date outside of the Internet though there are some  It is a form of democracy that is enabled by the Internet and one that may only have been possible in the small town meeting hall before the current age The scope of participatory democracy is one that balances the best of representational democracy with the ideals of direct democracy 

 

The variety of multistakeholder models are forms of participatory democracy Multistakeholder models builds on and includes the State based multilateral system in an attempt to move towards more participation by the people and the organizations they form Some states may do a decent job of representing the citizen residing within their geographically bounded territory for a particular set of interests related to that place and time  The states however do little for a wider set of rights-based interests people may have do nothing (or worse) for the non-citizens under their control (especially those who are undocumented) and have little to say about inter-jurisdictional disputes in the absence of treaty  Beyond that the state frequently infringes upon the rights of citizens residents and non-resident alike; rights they have agreed to by covenant  The other human rights based interests require greater participation than can be achieved by governments alone It is often Non Governmental Organizations that serve these rights and cross-border interests without discrimination based on geography nationality or other circumstance 

 

We all have seen though many ways in which the multistakeholder models that are being deployed are still underdeveloped and even flawed at times  There is still a lot to be complained about and improved upon   But to misquote Winston Churchill s quote on democracy 

 

“Multistakeholderism is the worst form of governance except all the others that have been tried   (Drake 2011)

 

The WGIG Background Report explained 

 

“Democracy is defined in different ways in a multilateral context and by different stakeholders according to their particular perspectives Governments generally hold to a view based on national sovereignty with equal say for all countries and decisions reached through consensus Each citizen is held to be represented and to be able to influence decisions through national consultation and decision-making mechanisms Some are of the view that most governments include members of their civil society in their delegations to the extent practical and in any case they take into account the interests of their civil societies when establishing agreements at multilateral bodies Civil society advocates on the other hand would argue that the term goes beyond this requiring direct full participation in decision making by many nongovernmental groups from the private sector and civil society Furthermore they have expressed the view that governments are not actively or consistently consulting with other sectors of society prior to establishing agreements within multilateral bodies  (Page 239 Paragraph 58)

 

This remains as true now as when it was wrritten a decade ago 

 

And when the context is the Internet this stakeholders extends to the technologists who built and preserve the system as well as the Internet Service Providers and other industries that deploy the technology  

 

Even when it comes to governmental representation governance of the Internet requires more stakeholder support than just the diplomatic and bureaucratic representatives of nation states that make up the multilateral system  The process needs the representation of the variety of governments stakeholders including regulators privacy protection law enforcement parliamentarians and others 

 

Whether it is NGOs that represent the needs and interests of the people they serve the technical community in their role as the creators and maintainers of the technology or the academics who attempt to understand the dynamics of the social systems within which we live in this highly interconnected world all of the stakeholder groups have a place at the table where they can discuss the issues and decide on solutions for Internet governance on an equal footing  Anything else leaves some interests without representation and thus leaves the populations who feel and express these interests unrepresented at least in that respect  

 

For humanity s interests to be democratically represented we need a multistakeholder framework that includes all people and organizations who have a stake in and care about the Internet participating with their own special perspective and skills; with roles and responsibilities that vary depending on the task at hand but which in the larger scope are on equal footing just as Tuvalu is on an equal footing equal footing with China in the UN system 

 

Full representation requires multistakeholder representation and that is a basic democratic principle

Effective use of the Internet will benefit everyone Currently the benefits of the Internet are distributed unequally some people gain power wealth and influence from using the Internet while others struggle for basic access In our vision people in their communities and everywhere - including the poor and marginalized in developing and developed countries women and youth indigenous peoples older persons those with disabilities -- will use the Internet to develop and exercise their civic intelligence and work together to address collective challenges 

 

More than a technology or a marketplace the Internet is a social environment a community space for people to interact with the expectation that principles of equity fairness and justice will prevail Internet governance must ensure that this online social space functions effectively for the well-being of all 

 

A community informatics approach to Internet governance supports equal distribution of Internet benefits and addresses longstanding social economic cultural and political injustices in this environment Questions of social justice and equity through the Internet are central to how the Internet and society will evolve People in different communities must be empowered to develop and adapt the Internet infrastructure to reflect their core values and ways of knowing 

 

We support development of an Internet in which communities are the first mile and not the last mile  We believe the primary purpose of the Internet is not to mine data and make knowledge a commodity for purchase and sale but rather to advance community goals equally and fairly within these distributed infrastructures 

 

We aspire to an Internet effectively owned and controlled by the communities that use it and to Internet ownership that evolves through communities federated regionally nationally and globally The Internet s role as a community asset a public good and a local community utility is more important than its role as a site for profit-making or as a global artifact The access layer and the higher layers of applications and content should be community owned and controlled in a way that supports a rich ecology of commercial enterprises subject to and serving community and public interests 

 

As citizens and community members in an Internet-enabled world we have a collective interest in how the Internet is governed Our collective interests need to be expressed and affirmed in all fora discussing the future of the Internet As a collective and as members of civil society we have developed a declaration for Internet governance based on principles of community informatics We appreciate your interest and welcome your support 

 

A just and equitable Internet provides 

 

    Fair and equitable means to access and use the Internet affordable by all and designed and deployed so that all may realize the benefits of effective use The poor and marginalized women youth indigenous peoples older persons those with disabilities Internet users and non-users alike; no one from any community globally should be without Internet access 
    Equitable access within communities to the benefits of the Internet including information opportunities to communicate increased effectiveness of communications and information management and opportunities to participate in system development and content creation Everyone within all communities should have the right the means and the opportunity to use the Internet to share the full intellectual heritage of humankind without undue cost or hindrance 
    Respect for privacy -- people must be able to conveniently use the Internet in a way that is credibly protected against large-scale surveillance or interference by government authorities or corporate interests 
    Infrastructure that ensures the maximum level of personal security and reliability 
    Opportunities for all within all communities to build manage and own Internet infrastructure as and when it is needed 
    Internet governance by democratic principles and processes - including privileging input from communities affected by decisions and ensuring inclusion of the widest possible perspectives supporting the development of our digital environments 
    A peer-to-peer architecture with equal power and privilege for each node or end point and complete neutrality of the architecture and medium for all users and all applications 
    Recognition that the local is a fundamental building block of all information and communications and the global is a federation of locals "
    Equal opportunity for all to connect and communicate in a language and culture of their choice 
    Recognition and equal privileging of many types of knowledge and ways of knowing building from the capacities of each individual community and knowledge society 
    The means for information freely provided on and through the Internet to be freely available for the use and benefit of all 
    Support for collaboration engagement education solidarity and problem-solving as the stepping stones to civic intelligence and the capacity of communities civil society and all people to equitably and effectively engage in informed self-governance

From 28th to 30th August 2013 was held in Kinshasa – Democratic Republic of Congo The 2nd Forum on Internet Governance in Central Africa under the theme Governance the Internet for a harmonious development and sustainable  

 

Five subjects were debate 

 

1       Security and Cybercrime

2       Protection and user rights on the internet

3       Critical Internet resource

4       Content Media and citizens  initiatives

5       Assessment and prospects

 

During the forum participants have contributed and enriched the discussions From these discussions it springs following recommendations that I would that the meeting Net Mundial 2014 considers too 

 

1 The need for involvement of the media to contribute to the awareness on the issues of ICT and use their privilege fourth power to influence the decision 

2 The need for Governments to host servers national locally 

3 The need to generate dynamic in Central Africa to bring governments the private sector and CSOs pose and solve all the problems of the sector ICT in Central Africa 

4 Undertake advocacy for the right to be recognized internet in the Charter of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights 

6 Conduct advocacy for the use of the Internet and ICTs contribute to the fight against girls and women violence

7 Conduct advocacy for the establishment of exchange points national regional and sub-regional and encourage Governments to get involved in the process of instead 

8 Promote the development of local content to enjoy autonomy of cultural heritage

 

I take this opportunity to express some concerns regarding the governance of the global Internet 

Is a single body necessary or sufficient for governance of Internet 

I think that the role of the US government and concerned that ICANN is not fully representative of all stakeholders and so there is not transparency in ICANN 

There are two options for ICANN s future The first is to place some of its functions under the authority of an intergovernmental body like the UN or the ITU an idea originally proposed at the WSIS The second is to give it independent private sector status with international multistakeholder input; I prefer the last option because Intergovernmental body (UN or ITU) proofed their limit about their roles Internet s success largely is due to private sector involvement and multistakeholder control may stifle innovation and investment 

Besides ICANN several organizations play a role in developing internet policies and standards including 

 

- The Internet Society (ISOC) an international membership organization responsible through groups such as the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) for developing internet technical standards 

- The World Wide Web Consortium open to subscribing organizations which develops technical standards and guidelines for the World Wide Web 

- The International Telecommunications Union (ITU) is a UN agency responsible for a wide range of telecommunication matters including technical standards and development activities 

- Various international organizations such as the World Trade Organization and the World Intellectual Property Organization                                                                                      

I think those organizations had to play more and important role in a new process of Internet Governance

This submission takes as its starting point the submission from participants of the Best Bits network on Roadmap for the Further Evolution of the Internet Governance Ecosystem – institutional mechanisms” (http //bestbits net/netmundial-roadmap/) which I participated in drafting and generally agree with (“the Best Bits submission”) 

 

In particular I take for granted the following points that are either drawn from or at least are fully consistent with the Best Bits submission and I will not explain them further here 

 

There are certain policy issues that cannot be addressed within the current Internet governance ecosystem in a way that adequately fulfils basic procedural criteria due to underlying institutional deficits 

 

    In addressing these deficits certain criteria must be fulfilled including a rights-based approach preservation of the global nature of the Internet and the use of multi-stakeholder democratic processes 

    To redress these deficits requires a new coordinating mechanism to direct stakeholders towards the appropriate existing fora to deal with policy issues as well as one or more new multi-stakeholder working groups to address issues that have no existing home 

    The new multi-stakeholder working groups referred to would in most cases develop soft law only rather than binding rules such as treaties though they could in appropriate cases make recommendations to external treaty bodies or to the UN General Assembly 

    It would be appropriate for the Internet Governance Forum (IGF) to take a key role in the operationalisation of these required changes which would require the most significant reforms to the IGF since its establishment 

 

 

There are however two problems that the Best Bits submission does not explicitly acknowledge nor suggest a way to overcome which are the subject of this submission 

 

(1) There remains a substantial disagreement between (and even within) stakeholder groups over whether governments should have a preeminent role and responsibility over international public policy issues pertaining to the Internet or whether the roles of all stakeholder groups in Internet policy development processes should be equal Practically speaking there is no likelihood that NETmundial will see any resolution of this fundamental disagreement 

 

In the narrower context of ICANN the GAC is an unsuccessful attempt to compromise between these two demands by giving governments certain rights in the policy development process that no other stakeholder group has (which upsets those who demand equality between the stakeholder groups) but by making its recommendations purely advisory (which upsets those who demand government sovereignty) 

 

It may seem that this problem is irreconcilable in that any governance institution must choose either one or the other – either making all stakeholders equal or giving governments sovereign rights But counter-intuitively it may be possible to satisfy both demands and to do so without creating any new body or process other than those referred to in the Best Bits submission The solution involves the following two elements 

 

(1a) First there are some issues and contexts in which as a factual matter governments do not claim a primary role in policy development nor ever have (and the same is true in other governance domains also) As these typically involve technical issues the drafters of the Tunis Agenda accounted for this fact by drawing a (simplistic) division between international public policy issues pertaining to the Internet” and day-to-day technical and operational matters that do not impact on international public policy issues 

 

A less simplistic approach requires a case-by-case analysis whenever the coordinating function as described in the Best Bits submission is exercised it should consider not only whether and where policy is being developed but also what the appropriate roles of stakeholders are for that issue Factors relevant to that determination include agreed high-level global Internet governance principles (if any) roles and responsibilities historically exercised in respect of that issue andthe governance mechanisms that are likely to be effective in dealing with the issue 

 

To give some possible examples it may be found that governments are entitled to take a leading role in developing global rules on money laundering via the Internet but that they should take a back seat in the development of spam filtering standards and should participate as equals with other stakeholders in the development of policy for transnational intellectual property enforcement policies 

 

By engaging in this analysis (which would itself be conducted by a multi-stakeholder deliberative body) a more reasoned determination can be made of the appropriate roles of governments and other stakeholders in a given issue area than can be had by resorting to fixed descriptions of stakeholder roles or an arbitrary demarcation between public policy” and technical and operational” issues The result will be that the appropriate role of governments in determining any given policy issue can be defined with more particularity than simply making a blanket claim of sovereignty 

 

 

(1b) Second for areas in which the coordinating function assesses that governments do have an appropriate role to play along with other stakeholders the only way in which to resolve the disagreement mentioned above is if the multi-stakeholder policy development process is so designed that the stakeholder groups are formally equal – but allows governments to veto decisions Logically the only way in which both those conditions can both be true is if all stakeholder groups can veto decisions 

 

This describes a consociational multi-stakeholder process where a consociation is a power-sharing arrangement comprising a coalition of stakeholder groups who cooperate in making decisions together but who share a right of mutual veto allowing any stakeholder group to block a joint decision if there is consensus to do so within that group Note that governments having a legal monopoly on the use of force have a de facto right of veto in any multi-stakeholder policy development process anyway; the consociational structure simply formalises this and grants the other stakeholder groups the same right (Malcolm 2008 pp 293-294 466-467 478-482) 

 

Does this mean that the power of veto would always be exercised so that nothing would ever be agreed  Of course it is possible as it is in any organisation that depends upon consensus But by adopting deliberative democratic processes the likelihood of a veto power being used strategically become less likely especially as the social capital invested by the stakeholders into the IGF compounds A stakeholder group will not use its power of veto lightly if this may damage its own longer-term prospects of using the IGF to advance its own interests later on 

 

 

(2) Whilst I support the decentralised model of Internet governance put forward in the Best Bits submission there is a second problem that the submission does not acknowledge The problem lies in the fact that it allows for the fact that there are a multiplicity of existing fora where global Internet public policies are developed but also demands that all of them adopt (afresh any many cases) a multi-stakeholder policy development process Although absolutely sound in theory there are two practical faults with this 

 

 

(2a) It is very optimistic to say the least to call for these existing multiple fora to be transformed into multi-stakeholder formats In many cases – the ITU for example – it will only take one member state to object to multi-stakeholder reforms in order to close down such transformation Therefore in practical terms this ideal is likely to be impossible to achieve 

 

 

(2b) Even if the previous objection were somehow overcome and there were a multiplicity of fully accessible and multi-stakeholder fora dealing with Internet policy issues the task of addressing all these fora would massive exceed the scope of civil society s limited financial and human capacity As the least well resourced stakeholder group this would put civil society at a further disadvantage when compared to governments and the private sector 

 

 

To correct for these faults requires a slight gloss upon the recommendations in the Best Bits submission that I outline here Essentially it involves allowing for a broader role for the Internet Governance Forum at least in the short term whereby the IGF – as the most accessible central policy forum for Internet policy discussion – would be tasked with developing recommendations for other institutions in the Internet governance ecosystem if those institutions do not themselves yet have a similar multi-stakeholder process 

 

This conforms with the IGF s existing mandate to promote and assess on an ongoing basis the embodiment of WSIS principles in Internet governance processes” (Tunis Agenda paragraph 72(i)) and to identify emerging issues bring them to the attention of the relevant bodies and the general public and where appropriate make recommendations” (paragraph 72(g) It is also consistent with its mandate to be non-duplicative (paragraphs 72(b) and 77) since a multi-stakeholder recommendation to an external institution is not to be considered duplicative of that institution s less inclusive decision-making process even if they both concern the same subject matter (Malcolm 2008 p 439) 

 

Thus notwithstanding that there may be a plethora of other Internet governance bodies the development of high-level principlesto guide the work of bodies that are not multi-stakeholder in their own right remains an appropriate activity for a reformed IGF 

 

Whilst the Best Bits submission does contend that it is a mistake to think that one body and one set of experts could possibly be responsible for effective policy making on all Internet-related matters” this is not what I propose The IGF would continue to have a very broad mandate yes But so too does the General Assembly of the United Nations and we do not hear complaints that it lacks expertise to cover all subject areas This is because the principal contribution of the General Assembly is not its expertise but its legitimacy – and so it is with the IGF only extending to other stakeholder groups besides governments 

 

Naturally the operational decision making that takes place by reference to the high-level principles that the IGF develops will remain the responsibility of more specialised bodies just as the implementation of resolutions of the General Assembly falls to national parliaments and specialised agencies in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity 

 

 

In summary and conclusion I fully accept the merits of a distributed model of Internet governance as set out in the Best Bits submission But I also caution as to two limitations that the submission does not cover 

 

 

The first is that it does not address the fundamental and irreconcilable disagreement over whether governments should or should not have greater policy authority than other stakeholders I suggest a way of overcoming that disagreement by firstly engaging in a more thorough analysis of the claims of each stakeholder stakeholder group to participate in policy development in a given issue area For issue areas in which governments are found to have a role I suggest that the concerns of governments that their sovereignty is threatened could be addressed by structuring the policy development process according to a consociational model that would give governments (and other stakeholder groups) a right of mutual veto over recommendations that they cannot support 

 

 

 

My second caution is that trying to retro-fit multi-stakeholder democratic legitimacy to a multitude of existing bodies in the short term is likely to prove a quixotic endeavour It is also unnecessary when there is already a multi-stakeholder Internet governance institution – the IGF – thatpossesses a UN mandate to make recommendations across a broad range of Internet public policy issues already has the trust and support of all non-governmental stakeholders and is much more accessible to civil society than that plethora of other bodies could ever be 

 

 

 

In this way the IGF with its proposed coordinating function can act as a proxy to receive multi-stakeholder input into the development of high-level principles for the guidance of other less multi-stakeholder institutions At the same time the IGF can host multi-stakeholder working groups to develop policy on issues for which there is no existing body to deal with them In both cases significant reforms to the IGF would be required – but these are much more achievable than the similar reforms required to transform the entire ecosystem of Internet governance institutions

Internet governance what next  
Abstract
Internet Governance has been the topic of endless discussion since the WSIS preparation
was launched in 2001 Most States insist on having equal say in decisions bearing not
only on technical matters but also on public policy and economic and societal matters at
both national and international level However the United States Government (USG)
remains fully determined to retain unilateral control over the internet While discussions
may go on for any number of years countries and citizens around the world cannot
afford to remain sitting ducks unable to control their future This paper explores possible
actions they may take without the USG approval to protect their human rights and
sovereignty and to acquire some bargaining power in the internet realpolitik

Internet Governance (IG) has been the topic of endless discussion since the WSIS (UN
World Summit on the Information Society) preparation was launched in 2001 Most States
insist on having equal say in decisions bearing not only on technical matters but also on
public policy and economic and societal matters at both national and international level 
However the United States Government (USG) remains fully determined to continue its
spying and mass surveillance operations and to retain unilateral control over the
internet through a private Californian company ICANN (Internet Corporation for Assigned
Names and Numbers) created in 1998 for this specific purpose 
Rhetoric and wishful thinking may go on for any number of years without any
predictable outcome While ideas and viewpoints may gradually become more flexible
and negotiable if the dominant party keeps expanding its power there will come a time
when negotiations will be irrelevant Discussion with no possibility of counteraction is a
losing game Are citizens of all countries thus to remain sitting ducks waiting to be
digitized and monetized  The ultimate goal of cyber-colonization 
2
What actions are possible  
Unless it serves the interests of the USG any action requiring USG agreement will be
blocked This is routine realpolitik Hence possible actions are those which can be
implemented without the USG s approval e g  
• apply national/regional laws to personal data privacy 
• apply national/regional fiscal laws to tax evasion 
• impose penalties on abusive market dominance 
• exclude illegitimate monopolies from major contracts 
• better balance investment/revenues between operators content providers ISPs and
media 
• protect natural plants from illegitimate patents 
• create national/regional domain registries independent from ICANN 
• open competition between multiple DNS roots 
• use open source software 
• promote user friendly end-to-end email encryption 
• keep object identifier registries and standards under trade control (ISO) 
• boost research/development on the future internet (RINA) 
•   others  
To some readers this may look like a laundry list However in the context of standing up
to a hyperpower a first level of defense is to make spying and predatory operations more
costly A second level is to carve out areas of independence to gain some bargaining
power In the longer term the objective is to make countries more resistant and better
prepared for aggressive intrusions 
Many of these suggested actions are self-explanatory and need no further clarification 
Let us look in more detail at the others 
• protect natural plants from illegitimate patents 
Example an insect resistant indigenous pepper variety grows in a Least Developed
Country (LDC) A multinational chemical group adds some useless ingredient to the
seeds and patents it It then sues local farmers for allegedly growing the patented pepper
without a license 
3
• create national/regional domain registries independent from ICANN 
Top Level Domains (TLD) such as  com  net  org are familiar even to non internet users 
Country code TLD (ccTLD) such as  cn  de  fr  it  us are also well known while most
people have never heard of e g  bz  gl  tp  vi 
New TLDs presently being introduced such
as  bike  construction  guru  photography  singles are largely unknown 
The USG imposed ICANN (created in 1998) as a monopoly in charge of all TLD
registrations This unilateral decision has no legitimate international basis A good
reason for such an anticompetitive status was to endow ICANN with a permanent cash
cow fed with domain rental fees paid by internet users In addition the costs of operating
root name servers is by and large supported by State (sponsored) institutions and private
companies that do not charge ICANN for this critical service Such mostly hidden
subsidies constitute unfair competition for independent roots and registries 
As usual with monopolies - and in this case backed by the USG - ICANN s top priority is
making more money for its lavish life style and buying new friends Being in the position
of both TLD regulator and financial beneficiary is a blatant case of conflict of interest 
There is a dire need to put the ICANN house in order and subject it to competition from
other actors in charge of defending user interests 
In fact starting in 1996 before ICANN was set up there were independent registries
created some were operated for several years and a few are still in existence e g 
Name-Space Cesidianroot-Europe OpenNic Slash/dot Name coin etc An unknown
number of private registries operate outside of conventional institutions and are mostly
invisible Whether due to ignorance misinformation or ICANN monopoly independent
registries are presently limited to niche markets As no international legal instrument
protects the ICANN monopoly the market could swing in other directions should States
or large institutions change policies or forego them 
• open competition between multiple DNS roots 
In the domain name field the term root designates a data set (usually a text file)
containing a collection of TLD parameters This file is duplicated within name servers"
queried by browsers and other applications to obtain an IP address associated with a
TLD In a nutshell this is the equivalent of looking up a subscriber s number in a phone
4
directory 
Root is a technical concept it contains the TLD parameters Registry is an organization
managing domain users and their identifiers A registry may use its own root (OpenNic) 
or the root of another organization (PIR Public Internet Registry uses the ICANN root) 
The ICANN dogma is that what is needed is a single global (i e USG controlled) root As
mentioned earlier independent registries and multiple roots have been in operation for
longer than ICANN but they ill suit a monopolist empire Curiously Google and
OpenDNS which are not registries use their own root copies of ICANN s 
The issue of a multiple root environment must be further explored in an article devoted
to the subject 
• promote user friendly end-to-end email encryption 
After Edward Snowden s revelations it is no longer possible to view security with benign
neglect Many but not all organizations will try harder to integrate security in their
procedures This will be reinforced by commercial pressures from the security industry 
Encryption is the basic ingredient of secure communications; it is used routinely in
closed environments but practically never in open environments Email is by and large
the dominant vessel for private and professional exchanges As long as encryption is
awkward to use or very slow it will not be adopted by the general public In addition
there must be a limited set of standardized protocols implemented in all mailers At this
point campaigns inciting users to adopt such safeguards could have a chance to succeed 
• keep object identifier registries and standards under trade control
(ISO) 
It has already been projected that the order of magnitude of objects in the internet will be
3 to 5 times larger than the number of humans Tools will be necessary for registration 
retrieval and exchange of identifiers Using DNS (Domain Name System) tools for
handling this type of data seems inadequate and unrealistic An example of a practical
system is GS1 for bar codes and RFID It is successful because it is carefully tailored to the
needs of a specific trade worldwide distribution of mass produced consumer goods
typically available in supermarkets Automobiles chemicals hospitals wine would
have different needs If the identifier management market falls into the hands of a world
monopoly it will impose its own proprietary standards irrespective of specific trade
needs and will distort manufacturing or distribution processes for its own profit 
5
Care must be taken to foster consensus within trades for identifier management
standards anchored in a reputable international organization such as the ISO
(International Organization for Standardization) 
• boost research/development on the future internet (RINA) 
As it stands today internet is an overpatched experimental system based on 40-year old
concepts The writing on the wall is obsolescence Research into the future internet has
gained more interest over the past ten years mainly through separate projects without
any focus on specific operational targets A team at Boston University managed to make
a breakthrough in network design published in Patterns in Network Architecture by
John Day The system name is RINA (Recursive InterNetwork Architecture) European
teams received contracts from the EU Commission research programme to expand the
initial platform by developing applications This is an opportunity for a new generation
of designers to close the security gaps of the legacy internet 
Trust is gone 
This is a matter of fact even though trust is subjective If you want peace prepare war"
is a well-worn mantra We don t really know how people in the USA will react to mass
surveillance for decades supposed to exist only in countries like China Russia East
Germany and so many others The logistics has reached a point from which there may be
no return A totalitarian regime more Orwellian than ever might take over We must
convince our governments and fellow citizens to steer clear of that model and technology 
We don t want to live in that kind of society do we

The Internet plays an important role in fostering knowledge education innovation and business It is a revolutionary tool which has had and will continue to have major  impacts on humanity and has drastically transformed every aspect of our being For the Internet to continue growing as a global tool beneficial to the public interest global  principles of Internet Governance need to be discussed agreed upon and adopted by all stakeholders of the Internet community 

 

Such agreement on Internet Governance principles should take into consideration the following 

 

1 Governance of the Internet should be based on a multi-stakeholder model with wide balanced and global representation of all stakeholder groups More efforts should be deployed to ensure wider engagement of stakeholders from developing countries to achieve a globally balanced multi-stakeholder model for Internet Governance 

 

2 While Internet public policies implementation is the main responsibility of governments the necessary mechanisms should be adopted to encourage a bottom up and community driven approach in designing those policies to best serve the public interest 

 

3 Respecting international laws rights and freedoms are the responsibility of every Internet stakeholder The internet must guarantee Human Rights and freedoms  as ordained in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the international Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and any other pertinent legal document 

 

4 Users  Rights online are central and should be improved materialization of those rights offline Current legislation applied on the Internet which hinders any aspect of the basic human rights as stipulated in international instruments should be reviewed and adapted to guarantee that Internet rights are identical to offline rights 

 

5 Open inclusive neutral and unrestricted access to the Internet is central to democratic and socio-economic development Data protection privacy security and freedom of expression are basic to the development of the Internet 

 

6 The rule of law open equal unhindered affordable access and multilingualism are basic requirements for every Internet user to be empowered to reap the full benefit of internet resources Any adopted governance mechanisms should be based on worldwide best practices to avoid Internet censorship 

 

7 While the general security and the protection of the users and their rights are global multi-stakeholder responsibility lead by governments the day-to-day technical management of the Internet is the responsibility of the private sector and the technical community None of these responsibilities (i e neither security and the protection of the citizens nor technical management) should undermine the general principles of Internet neutrality transparency and Inclusiveness of all stakeholders in the decision making process 

 

8 State sovereignty stipulated by international treaties and users privacy should be respected and protected from external surveillance operations 

 

9 The Internet is a global public good  Critical Internet resources including root servers names and numbers need to be managed globally through a model that is fair transparent and accountable to the international Internet community 

Internet Governance Principles

We firmly believe that global Internet governance should be based on the mulltistakeholder model and protection of human rights two principles that are considered to be critical in sustaining the past and future of an Internet for the global community 

 
Genuine Multistakeholder Model

 

The influence of public policies on the Internet are transnational by nature and thus are being developed by the contributions and responsibilities of various global stakeholders Therefore it is essential that all relevant stakeholders are given equality of opportunity to participate in the shaping of Internet policies However the current Internet governance system has not fully ensured multistakeholder principles in its genuine meaning The transparency of the policy shaping process has sometimes not been ensured and thus has been criticized as non-democratic and some stakeholders were not given the opportunity to participate in a meaningful way Public policies that significantly affect the Internet such as the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement(ACTA) had been developed completely in a non-transparent manner excluding the participation of various stakeholders 

 

The recent emphasis on the multistakeholder model by numerous international organizations discussing Internet related public policies and the acceptance of this principle by many governmental organizations is definitely an encouraging sign However various interpretations of the multistakeholder model exist some even going so far as to mean merely consulting the relevant stakeholders in the policy development process While we do not believe that a single type of the multistakeholder model fits all we firmly believe that we need to come to a consensus on following principles that need to be included in order to develop global Internet policies based on multistakeholder model 

 

    Transparency There should be full public disclosure of any information related to the policy as well as of the process of the development of the policy 
    Inclusiveness All stakeholders should have the opportunity to participate equally in the policy development process either online or offline 
    Accountability Implementation of the policies should be monitored and evaluated regularly by all stakeholders or independent bodies 
    Balance The opinions of the various stakeholders should be given an equal status and a mechanism preventing the capture of the process by any one dominant stakeholder needs to be instituted allowing for sufficient deliberation among the stakeholders 
    Proactive measure for disadvantaged groups We need a mechanism for mitigating the unequal power that exists among the various stakeholders so that the disadvantaged groups may have a fair and meaningful opportunity to participate Thus extra effort needs to be exerted on issues such as funding remote participation and capacity building 

 

In order to ensure a genuine multistakeholder model we need to update and revise the Tunis Agenda Paragraph 34 of the Tunis Agenda defines ‘working definition of Internet governance  in which the stakeholders would be involved in internet governance in their respective roles  and then paragraph 35 defines the roles” of each stakeholder However the difficulty here is that there is no clear method of defining ‘stakeholders  and also that different types of issues will necessarily entail different stakeholders 

 

The roles of each stakeholder defined in paragraph 35 is not an adequate representatation of actual situations For example Civil society participation is not limited to the local community level Civil societies all over the world are proactively participating in the full policy shaping process of not only local but global issues as an important stakeholder in many areas and our expertise on practical advocacy experiences as technical academic and business experts have been appreciated not only in our local communities but also in many global foras Civil society is defending protecting taking solidarity actions with converging and sometimes representing the interests of marginalized and disadvantaged people who are end-users as well as content generators over the Internet Moreover civil society as an agent advocating global public interests rather than private or national interests realizes the universal value of human rights even in internet policy areas which are predominatedly  being affected by the establishment of the privileged private interests or big powers 

 

Moreover paragraph 35 declares that the policy authority of Internet-related public policy issues are ‘the sovereign rights of states  but when we consider that the Internet is transnational by nature and thus requires the cooperation of various stakeholders we should include the equal participation of such stakeholders in the policy making process We acknowledge however the importance of the roles and responsibilities of governments of individual countries in setting national as well as global public policies 

 
Human Rights based approach 

 

The ultimate goal of utilizing the Internet as an essential resource in our society should be to promote the progress and happiness of the human race and as such Internet governance principles should adopt the protection of human rights as its cardinal value Numerous principles and charters on the Internet such as the IRP charter of the Internet Rights & Principles Coalition and the  Internet Rights Chater declared by the Association for Progressive Communications(APC) have detailed human rights provisions that need to be protected We would like to place special emphasis on the following human rights principles 

 

    Freedom of Expression Although the Internet is basically an open space for all numerous Internet postings are still taken down or blocked access to for violation of a variety of rules and regulations We would like to stress that Internet postings should never be taken down or blocked access to by the administration without a proper decision by the judiciary system The censorship and control of expressions posted on the Internet being subject to the discretion of the administrative body is inconsistent with the international responsibilities of each countries to adhere to international treaties on  human rights In addition the right to remain anonymous should be protected 
    Privacy The right to privacy that is guaranteed by article 12 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights(UDHR) is one of the most important prerogatives and is a key element in sustaining the trustworthiness of the Internet The right to informational self-determination is a principle that is declared to be protected by  UN Guidelines concerning computerized personal data files as well as by various national legal systems However in a global Internet environment it is becoming increasingly more difficult to protect the rights of individuals The revelation in 2013 of surveillance by a state s intelligence agency has greatly weakened the trustworthiness of the Internet Thus  in line with ‘the International Principles on the Application of Human Rights to Communications Surveillance  that has been proposed by the international civil society we feel that it is necessary to establish a system that can prevent such mass surveillance In this regard the adoption of ‘The Right to Privacy in the Digital Age  in November 2013 by the UN general assembly represents a huge leap forward 
    Net Neutrality The freedom and openness that characterize the Internet are two critical elements that ensure its development and success These principles together with those of non-discrimination and fair competition must continue to be an essential force behind its development People s rights to use the device of their choice to access Internet content applications and services without discrimination or limitations should be guaranteed 
    Right of Access to Knowledge and Culture The Internet allows the opportunity for global sharing of knowledge and culture and thus enables the creation of innovative ideas and novel cultures through a mechanism of cooperation that contributes to the advancement of our society Thus publicly funded intellectual and cultural products should be open for public use In addition we need to re-evaluate the adverse effects of artificial monopoly rights that are given to intellectual and cultural products on the creation of innovative knowedge and cultures and consider establishing a new system for creative intellectual products 

 
Roadmap 

 

We would like to propose the following principles related to the future of Internet ecosystems 

 

The Internet governance ecosystem should be founded on the principles stated above Existing organizations related to Internet governance should be evaluated based on those principles thus becoming more transparent in their operations and ensuring the participation of all stakeholders The Internet governance ecosystem should be able to reflect a genuine multistakeholder model 

 

Since 2005 the Internet Governance Forum has been instrumental in providing a forum for the various stakeholders to come together and develop cooperative relationships through open discussions We need to pay special attention to the recommendations of the Working Group on Improvements to the Internet Governance Forum” when considering the future Internet governance ecosystems The role of the IGF should be enhanced so that it may produce tangible outputs regarding Internet governance We hope that this ‘Global Multistakeholder Meeting on the Future of Internet Governance would enable the IGF to continue to be an important forum for discussing future Internet governance arrangements

All use of the Internet is intermediated by software--it is impossible to use the Internet without using software While most of us agree about the need for the Internet to be Free little attention is paid to the need for the software and protocols of the Interent to be Free as well 

The emergence and mainstreaming in the last two decades of Free Libré and Open Source Software (FLOSS or FOSS) as a distinct model of production consumption distribution and maintenance of software--in contrast to the Proprietary/Closed Source Software (PCSS) model--shows that the values that underpin it are sound and acceptable to communities around the world 

There is general acceptance today that a global resource such as the Internet should be governed by Open Standards vis-à-vis its underlying protocols This submission argues that this need for Open Standards is necessary but not sufficient and that every Open Standard must have reference implementations that are FOSS-based and further that wherever possible FOSS-based software implementations should be given preference over PCSS-based software 

Apart from other important quality parameters--such as robustness low-cost extensibility customizability security auditability and less restrictive licenses--a key differentiator for FOSS-based software is that it upholds Freedoms--of developers users communities and nations--and is consequently a more ethical alternative than PCSS Thus FOSS is a natural fit in the context of preserving Internet Freedoms 

Therefore any discussion on Internet Governance is incomplete without FLOSS and users at large would benefit from utilizing FOSS-based software at least for reference implementations but even better for all applications on the Internet 

Internet Governance Principles

The Spanish Internet Governance Forum welcomes the opportunity of contributing to the ongoing debate on a set of Internet Governance Principles The set of principles proposed in this document have been taken from the messages of the last Spanish IGF meeting in Madrid in which all stakeholders were involved 

 

1     Multistakeholder governance The multistakeholder governance model provides a more benefits on its attempt to guarantee a free open and innovating Internet than those potentially obtained through other governance schemes based on the unilateral participation of states or enterprises 

2     One single and non-fragmented network The global nature of the Internet must be recognized and we should aim at providing universal access through open standards that allow interoperability 

3     Sustainable Internet It is necessary to maintain feasible business models for all players in the value chain of the Internet that allows long-term sustainability 

4     Freedom and human rights The use of the Internet must be driven by the principles of freedom of expression and the respect for human rights The same principles as applied offline 

5     Cybersecurity It is necessary to reinforce security in the Internet in particular the protection of minors e g against cyber-bullying 

6     Open governance Internet governance must be exercised in a transparent open inclusive and accountable manner 

7      Empowerment of the Internet users Access to information should be allowed when it is still possible to participate or influence in the procedure Users must be able to exercise their rights and freedoms 

8     Privacy An important goal should be to achieve a regulatory balance through a harmonized regulation able to provide similar answers to similar situations throughout every country as well as to protect citizens  rights wherever the service provider is established 

9     Accessibility Universal access to the Internet should be promoted providing both access to the network as well as developing digital skills for all users independently from their age building or financial circumstances 

10  More active role of Europe in Internet Governance We must seek for ways to allow convergence and fluent decision making within the European Union which allow all interested stakeholder assume a more active role regarding internet governance 

Democratising Global Governance of the Internet

 

The Coalition for a Just and Equitable Internet (Just Net Coalition) was formed at a meeting in Delhi in February 2014 It comprises several dozen organisations and individuals from different regions globally concerned with internet governance human rights and social justice and the relationship between them 

 

How to Achieve a Just and Equitable Internet for All

 

The Internet has become a vitally important social infrastructure that profoundly impacts our societies  We are all citizens of an Internet-mediated world whether as the minority who uses it or the majority who does not  The Internet must advance human rights and social justice  Internet governance must be truly democratic 

 

The Internet is reorganising public institutions including those related to governance welfare health and education as well as key sectors such as media communications transport and finance It has transformed the way we do many things but the benefits promised for all have not been adequately realized On the contrary - we have seen mass surveillance abusive use of personal data and their use as a means of social and political control; the monopolization commodification and monetisation of information and knowledge; inequitable flows of finances between poor and rich countries; and erosion of cultural diversity  Many technical and thus purportedly  neutral  decisions have in reality led to social injustice as technology architectures often developed to promote vested interests increasingly determine social economic cultural and political relationships and processes 

 

Opportunities for the many to participate in the very real benefits of the Internet and to fully realize its enormous potential are being thwarted by growing control of the Internet by those with power - large corporations and certain national governments They use their central positions of influence to consolidate power and to establish a new global regime of control and exploitation; under the guise of favouring liberalization they are in reality reinforcing the dominance and profitability of major corporations at the expense of the public interest and the overarching position of certain national interests at the expense of global interests and well being 

 

Existing governance arrangements for the global Internet are inadequate They suffer from a lack of democracy; an absence of legitimacy accountability and transparency; excessive corporate influence and regulatory capture; and too few opportunities for effective participation by people especially from developing countries  The situation can be remedied only through fundamental changes to the current governance arrangements 

 

The governance of the Internet must proceed from the position that inter-connectivity cannot serve human rights and social justice unless it leads to and supports distributed power particularly to the grassroots but also across the various Internet divides—social economic political Ensuring that the Internet does not in fact lead to greater centralisation of power will therefore require appropriate interventions at all levels of Internet governance Building an effective framework to achieve these objectives is the greatest challenge today in terms of global governance of the Internet 

 

We have outlined elsewhere the principles that in our view must underpin the Internet in the future 

 

We offer here an outline of a framework for how to implement these principles in the future This framework should underpin the emergence of an Internet that advances human rights and social justice globally and the reconfiguration of Internet governance into a truly democratic space 

 

A roadmap for democratising global governance of the Internet

 

1 New global governance mechanisms are needed We believe that two distinct mechanisms are needed one that looks at the global Internet-related public policy issues in various social economic cultural and political domains and another that  undertakes oversight of the technical and operational functions related to the Internet (basically replacing the current unilateral oversight of ICANN and IANA  by the US government) This will require the setting up of appropriate new global governance bodies as well as a framework of international law to facilitate their work as follows 

 

2 A new UN body for Internet-related public policy issues An anchor global institution for taking up and addressing various public policy issues pertaining to the Internet in an ongoing manner is urgently required It can be a committee attached to the UN General Assembly or a more elaborate and relatively autonomous body linked loosely to the UN (as a specialized UN body) It should have a very strong and institutionalized public consultative mechanism in the form of stakeholder advisory groups that are selected through formal processes by different stakeholder constituencies ensuring adequate representativeness (OECD s Committee on Computer Information and Communication Policy[1]and India s recent proposal for a UN Committee on Internet-related Policies[2] are two useful and somewhat similar models that can be explored ) This  new body  will stay abreast of global Internet-related issues; where necessary develop international level public policies in the concerned areas; seek appropriate harmonization of national level policies; and facilitate required treaties conventions and agreements It will also have the necessary means to undertake studies and present analyses in different policy areas 

 

Most Internet-related public policy issues are of a cross-cutting nature and overlap with mandates of other existing global governance bodies such as WIPO UNESCO WTO UNDP UNCTAD ITU and so on This proposed new  body  would establish appropriate relationships with these other existing bodies including directing relevant public policy issues to them receiving their inputs and comments and itself contributing specific Internet-related perspectives to issues under the purview of these other bodies 

 

3 A new  Internet Technical Oversight and Advisory Board  This Board will replace the US government s current oversight role over the technical and operational functions performed by ICANN The membership of this oversight Board can be of a techno-political nature i e consisting of people with specialized expertise but who also have appropriate political backing ascertained through a democratic process For instance the Board can be made of 10/15 members with 2/3 members each from five geographic regions (as understood in the UN system) These members can perhaps be selected through an appropriate process by the relevant technical standards bodies and/or country domain name bodies of all the countries of the respective region They could perhaps come from top recognised technical academic bodies of each country/ region One member each from each Regional Internet Registries could also be included (Other mechanisms for constituting the techno-political membership of this Board could also be considered )

 

3 1       The Internet Technical Oversight and Advisory Board will seek to ensure that the various technical and operational functions related to the global Internet are undertaken by the relevant organizations as per international law and public policy principles developed by the concerned international bodies 

 

3 2       The Technical Oversight and Advisory Board will have a dual role (1) oversight of decisions of ICANN related to its various functions of managing and coordination of critical Internet resources and (2) advice on public policy perspectives to various technical standards bodies and in this regard be the link between public policy bodies and these standards bodies The function of oversight could be arranged to be undertaken either ex ante - before changes are made in the root files or ex post - after the changes are made as confirming them The advisory role of this Board vis a vis technical standards bodies will be non-binding 

 

3 2       With regard to ICANN the role of this Board will be comparable to that exercised by the US government in its oversight over ICANN As for the decentralized Internet standards development mechanisms like the Internet Engineering Task Force these self organising systems based on voluntary adoption of standards will continue to work as at present The new Board will have operating principles ensuring a very light touch and non-binding role It will bring in imperatives from and advise technical standards bodies on international public policies international law and norms being developed by various relevant bodies 

 

3 3       The enable the Board to fulfil its oversight mandate ICANN must become an international organisation without changing its existing multistakeholder character in any substantial manner It would enter into a host country agreement with the US government (or with the government of another country) It would have full immunity from national law and executive authority and be guided solely by international law and be incorporated under it Supervision of the authoritative root zone server would also be transferred to this Board and it would exercise this role with the help of an internationalised ICANN 

 

3 4       This board will also advise the afore-mentioned new public policy body on technical matters pertaining to the Internet policy making as well as take public policy inputs from it 

 

4 Framework Convention on the Internet An appropriate international legal framework will be required sooner rather than later for the above bodies to function properly Accordingly one of the early tasks of the proposed new body” dealing with Internet-related public policy issues discussed above will be to help negotiate a Framework Convention on the Internet” (somewhat similar to the Framework Convention on Climate Change[3]) Governance of the Internet concerns a variety of issues that are ever evolving It is therefore preferable to formulate an enabling legal structure as a framework convention” rather than as a specific treaty or convention that addresses only a bounded set of issues 

 

4 1       Such a Framework Convention can initially introduce a series of principles protocols and processes that can then frame further treaties agreements etc on more specific issues  It will thus enable appropriate and ongoing global policy responses to various opportunities and challenges presented by the fast-evolving phenomenon of the Internet It will also formalise the basic architecture of the global governance of the Internet; inter alia recognising and legitimising the existing roles and functions of the various bodies currently involved with managing the technical and logical infrastructure of the Internet including the ICANN Regional Internet Registries Internet technical standards bodies and so on 

 

4 2       There will also be a need for the development of institutional mechanisms for crisis response and dispute resolution in relation to the global Internet and the social activities that depend on it 

 

4 3       The idea of a framework convention and/or greater involvement of UN institutions has been criticized for various reasons including a reduction of democracy infringement on national sovereignty threats to freedom of speech a risk of slowing innovation 

 

4 4       In our view only appropriate government involvement can ensure democracy for a number of reasons Private companies are not democratic institutions and are obliged to act in the interests of owners and shareholders; nations can and frequently do limit their sovereignty voluntarily by agreeing treaties and such treaties are binding only after they are ratified by national parliaments thus ensuring the respect of democratic decision-making; human rights including the right to free speech are protected by customary internal law enunciated in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and cannot be limited by any of the mechanisms outlined above; and appropriate government intervention can foster competition and innovation and indeed calls for net neutrality regulation are intended to have exactly this effect 

 

5 Funding Recognising that the current process of domain name registration in reality acts as a license fee or excise tax on Internet users funding for the proposed new global Internet policy mechanisms would come from the collections made by relevant bodies from the allocation of naming and numbering resources pertaining to the global Internet (like the fee that ICANN collects annually from each domain name owner) These accruals now run into millions of dollars every year and could be adequate to fund a large part of the needed mechanisms for democratic governance of the global Internet

PRESS FREEDOM IN NEW COMMUNICATION MEDIA

 

 

 

The members of the Coordinating Committee of Press Freedom Organizations issued the following statement defending and promoting press freedom on the Internet and other new forms of communication They recalled their Statement of Vienna of November 2002 issued in advance of the World Summits on the Information Society reaffirmed in February 2007 

 

 

 

They renewed their attachment to its principles in the following terms 

 

 

 

1 News media in cyberspace via international satellite broadcasts and using other new forms of communication should be afforded the same freedom of expression rights as traditional news media The texts adopted by the World Summits on the Information Society reflected that view A free press means a free people Press freedom on the Internet must be a fundamental characteristic of this and of any new communication system 

 

 

 

2 This principle was embodied in UNESCO s 1997 Declaration of Sofia  The access to and the use of these new media should be afforded the same freedom of expression protections as traditional media 

 

 

 

This declaration adopted by a broad cross-section of journalists from both East and West Europe was formally endorsed by the member states of UNESCO at its General Conference in 1997 

 

 

 

This has now been unanimously reaffirmed by the United Nations Human Rights Council in a resolution stating The same rights that people have offline must also be protected online in particular freedom of expression 

 

 

 

3 A major priority must be implementation of Article 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights Everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression; this right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek receive and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers 

 

 

 

That pledge made by the international community in 1948 must be a living reality everywhere 

 

 

 

4 There are many types of communication over the Internet and other new media and it is important not to confuse them News for example differs from such activities as pornography pedophilia fraud conspiracy for terrorism incitement to violence hate speech etc although there may be news stories about such problems Such matters as those listed are normally covered in existing national general legislation and can if appropriate and necessary be prosecuted on the national level in the country of origin 

 

No new legislation or international treaty is necessary 

 

 

 

5 Some countries that have advocated controls over the free flow of information across national frontiers have tried to justify such controls on political grounds regional value systems or national information sovereignty Such controls are clearly in violation of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights 

 

 

 

6 Over the years developing countries have complained of being unequal partners in world communication ability The new information technologies afford just the opportunity for interactive and multi-way communication that these developing world critics have said they want For those in many countries Article 19 is still a promise rather than a reality The new communication technologies could go a very long way toward fulfilling the promise 

 

 

 

7 Those who seek answers to the so-called digital divide” neglect to recall that previous communication technologies such as printing radio and television also started in advanced more developed countries and spread virtually throughout the world largely thanks to natural market processes The rate of spread of each successive new communication technology accelerated radically According to the International Telecommunication Union it took 38 years for the first 50 million radio sets to be in place worldwide 13 years for the first 50 million television sets and just four years for the first 50 million Internet connections More than 2billion persons are now said to have access to Internet worldwide 

 

 

 

8 Because general principles are at stake there is concern that controls instituted for new communication technologies could wash back” into controls over traditional news media This would be regressive and tragic Nothing that could work in this manner should be permitted 

 

 

 

9 A number of proposals for regulation and controls now being made were rejected during the now-discredited campaign for a  new world information and communication order  There are clearly those at work who seek to revive and assert for their own purposes such restrictive proposals in the new guise of countering alleged threats and dangers posed by new communication technologies These proposals must again be successfully resisted just as they were earlier 

 

 

 

10 Many of the fears over the new communication technologies expressed by officials and politicians seem to reflect anxieties about the new and unfamiliar which they do not control Such anxieties often reflect ignorance on what the new communication technologies really are and of how they work They can also reflect a fear of freedom 

 

 

 

Discussions of many alleged problems are often conducted on the basis of unproved assertions and speculations Rigorously researched hard data is missing to describe the supposed threats posed by the new communication technologies with these unproven dangers used to justify the calls for controls 

 

 

 

11 If successful proposals to control content and its dissemination through new information technologies would severely constrain their rapid spread and development 

 

 

 

12 In the broader freedom of expression context existing international copyright regimes and intellectual property rights agreements are generally speaking an indispensable encouragement to creation and innovation Those who seek to undermine such existing conventions on the grounds of free access would in fact succeed only in drastically reducing incentives for developing and distributing information Yet legitimate attempts to protect copyright should under no circumstances be allowed to be used as a cover for state or private censorship 

 

 

 

13 Most people in the world continue to receive their news and information through traditional broadcast and print media and are likely to continue to do so for the foreseeable future 

 

 

 

14 The various follow-ups to the World Summits on the Information Society provide both opportunities to broaden the reach of freedom of expression as well as dangers from those who would narrow it -- unthinkingly or deliberately 

 

 

 

15 Everyone involved in following up on the unfinished business of those Summits should bear firmly in mind the need to maximize opportunities for extending press freedom and to resist the threats to restrict it To that end civil society and all those engaged in news flows over the Internet and other new media must continue to be an integral part of the deliberations at every stage The future of new and evolving forms of communication cannot be left to governments and technocrats alone 

 

 

 

16 Proposals to subject the Internet to control authority or oversight by an intergovernmental body or organization run the risk of reducing its content to the lowest common denominator that authoritarian member governments would allow Current arrangements have in practice served Internet freedom and any measures to replace those arrangements should be resisted if they present any dangers of introducing restrictions to the continued free flow of information in cyberspace 

 

 

 

17 The Coordinating Committee of Press Freedom Organizations calls for concerted effort to make preserving and extending the free flow of news and information in cyberspace and elsewhere an ongoing basic concern News on the Internet and other new forms of communication is the same as news everywhere New technology does not require any reconsideration of fundamental rights such as freedom of the press 

 

 

 

We call on those involved in deliberations on the future of new forms of communication to 

 

 

 

a) reject any proposal aimed at restricting news content or media operations 

 

b) work for inclusion of clear statements of unqualified support for press freedom on the Internet and other new forms of communication in any new agreements or declarations of principle on the subject 

 

c) stipulate in any text that could be used restrictively a clear statement that the particular provision involved is not intended to limit freedom of expression or press freedom 

 

d) support continuation of access and dissemination of news and information in cyberspace without compromise of the principle of net neutrality ”

 

e) recognize that existing protections of  journalists  sources offline also apply to online journalism and that actors in the online world should do nothing to compromise the safety of journalists 

 

 

 

There must be press freedom in all the new spaces created for communication 

Toward a Single Global Digital Economy 
The First Report of the Aspen Institute IDEA Project
Introduction
The Internet is the most robust medium of information exchange in history 
Two billion people are now connected and at current growth rates everyone with
Internet access will join the Internet community within a decade Barring technological
and political disruptions the world s populace will then be on a single
common digital platform The global medium can provide unparalleled personal
well-being economic growth and beneficial social change 
The risk of technological and political disruption now looms very large The
power of the medium to promote change has produced a counter-revolutionary
response among many political and business interests In numerous countries 
leaders have called for government to interrupt the free flow of data (the essence
of the Internet) at state borders and to create within political boundaries unique
national regimes for regulating the Internet Regulation in many instances means
the specific curtailment of the capability to exercise the full potential for change
provided by the Internet In some cases business and government leaders have
called for bilateral or multilateral government regulation sponsored for example 
by the United Nations These calls raise grave risks to the robust expansion of the
Internet that do not seem outweighed by any benefits that might be created for the
Internet community 
To consider now in what still are the early years of the global spread of the
Internet the appropriate forms of governance of this medium the Aspen Institute 
supported by major foundations and working with a broad array of stakeholders 
conducted the two-year project called the International Digital Economy Accords—
the Aspen Institute IDEA Project This is the report emanating from IDEA 
Summary of Opportunity and Risks
The Aspen IDEA Project began by considering the advantages of a single common
medium Technological advances in computing and mobility and in software
and data-driven services can foster the growth of the Internet to everyone
everywhere As it grows in scale and scope the Internet advances creativity and
learning accelerates innovation in new and existing businesses and enhances the

creation and delivery of public goods including better government The Internet
can empower citizens of any state or every state to work together to grow their
economies and solve their social problems Its building block is the individual
user but its value is in the network effects of a common global medium 
The Internet s building block is the individual user but its
value is in the network effects of a common global medium 
As a global network the Internet gives the farmer in Africa instant access to
weather conditions crop prices and health information It allows migrant workers
in the United Arab Emirates to connect with family and friends left behind in India 
It enables children in rural Brazil to take virtual tours of museums in Europe or to
engage in massive multiplayer games with peers in Asia and around the world It
offers small businesses in Indonesia Ireland or Ethiopia cheap and flexible fulfillment
possibilities as they access global markets It serves the aspirations of individuals
everywhere whether they are advancing their personal well-being their local
communities their standards of living or their aims for self-governance 
In addition the Internet has a magic quality that reinforces its own potential 
namely the Internet thrives because no single government or private firm or even
group of governments or firms controls it It is run by the many for the benefit
of all 
It is in everyone s interest then to have a trusted robust and reliable Internet 
where access is easy and where the rights of privacy property and security are
respected But the advantages of a global common medium evaporate if the
Internet fragments into regional or local networks If countries wall themselves off
from the global medium or unduly restrict users  access to content or if jurisdictional
niceties block the transfer of information across borders the public suffers
in the following ways 
• Undue barriers to trade and increased protectionism lead to the loss of
the benefits of competition lower prices choice of services and increased
innovation 
• Deviations from a rule-of-law approach lead to a lack of trust as it relates
to privacy security and intellectual property protection 
• Lack of harmonization can lead to differences in deployment of broadband
infrastructure impede spectrum management and hamper interoperability 
• Jurisdictional and regulatory differences can lead to differences in the
adoption of human rights particularly with respect to the freedoms of
communication 
The Report 5
Yet as with free trade or free speech the Internet is such a powerful medium
for change that some governments and firms want to control it in order to limit
its impact Indeed even if no one can know the ultimate outcome of the recent
challenge to the long-standing government of Egypt when that government shut
down its people s access to the global Internet the world learned a new lesson
about the importance of connectivity 
The advantages of a global common medium evaporate if
the Internet fragments into regional or local networks 
We are now at an important crossroads in how the Internet will evolve as a
global common medium Will it remain open free to unleash tremendous innovation
and to be the engine of economic growth  Or it will become fragmented 
where the free flow of information and services will be hampered and locked down
into separate zones of control 
Today there is a window of opportunity to develop a baseline of principles 
policies and practices that can promote the Internet as a global medium and prevent
fragmentation That is why the Aspen Institute Communications and Society
Program convened the IDEA Project 
How IDEA Was Conducted
The goal of the Aspen Institute International Digital Economy Accords (IDEA)
Project was to establish a fair effective and empowering system for governing
the flow and use of data in a single global digital economy The Project engaged
businesses and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) in the design of enduring
principles and of a governance system that implemented those principles At the
center of IDEA s mission was the establishment of the Internet as the common
medium through which all of the world s people could securely fairly openly and
freely exercise their economic and human rights It became clear as well that a
multistakeholder approach to governance would be best 
To persuade all to adopt a multistakeholder process based on durable principles 
IDEA took on two tasks (1) to develop a consensus view about the beliefs
and values of the Internet and (2) to construct a means of implementing that view 
The test of success would be whether the ideas of IDEA could resolve real cases
of deviation from generally accepted principles and problematic cases of enforcement
of said principles There were many dramatic examples of hard cases in these
last two years 
6 Toward a Single Global Digital Economy
The goal of the IDEA Project was to establish a fair 
effective and empowering system for governing the flow
and use of data in a single global digital economy 
The Project proceeded by means of four plenary sessions multiple working
groups and a series of working papers and documents At least 36 American and
European companies 14 representatives of civil society and 4 foundations were
represented All devoted much time and intellectual capital to the effort Highlevel
government officials from 6 countries representing 18 different agencies
provided valuable input and insights This two-year process has led to this report 
which (1) publishes the Aspen IDEA Principles and (2) advances some thoughts
about a multistakeholder trade-based implementation system 
As to broad principles the Aspen IDEA Project produced a clear statement of the
ideal Internet culture The Principles resulted from an extensive process although
they were not endorsed by each of the participants and cannot in whole or in part 
be attributed to any specific participant or group of participants in the Project 
Nevertheless the Principles were aimed at delivering common views among commercial 
civil society and individual users on the most significant and difficult issues
facing Internet governance These Principles are as follows the free flow of communications;
free trade of digital goods services and ideas; creation of a trusted
environment for use of the Internet (including two sides of a coin of rights—piracy
and privacy); and transparency in a multistakeholder process The Aspen IDEA
Principles may have influenced and at least supplemented principles developed at
other forums including the government-sponsored work at the Organisation for
Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) in what a White House official
participating on the Project called The Year of Principles–2011 
With respect to any set of principles the test for their efficacy is Do they speak
to problems that most agree need solving  As discussed below the Aspen IDEA
Principles pass this test 
As to the implementation of the Principles the Project aimed to define a multistakeholder
process or trade agreement that emphasized market access for broadband
at the hardware software and content levels No adequate mechanism now
exists to carry the culture of the Internet—the fabric of beliefs and values shared by
more than two billion people—to all the expanding frontiers of the Internet The
Project s goal was to define a mechanism that did not require government enforcement
of the Aspen IDEA Principles but did encourage respect for the Principles
by every nation and all the interest groups in every nation The result sought was
to generate a digital economy that demonstrated respect for rights of property 
The Report 7
privacy security and that acknowledged all human rights The essence of such an
implementation mechanism is the idea of multistakeholder governance for the
Internet These enforcement mechanisms were designed to carry that notion into
governance of a single global digital economy 
The Project also hoped to outline a trade-based solution that was to be
based in large part on the success of the World Trade Organization s Basic
Telecommunications Agreement (BTA) which is annexed to the General
Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS) The negotiations of the GATS were
started by the WTO in Marrakesh in 1993 The basic principles in the BTA were
defined by U S Vice President Al Gore in a major speech to the International
Telecommunications Union (ITU) Development Conference in Buenos Aires in
early 1994 Drawing on that precedent the Project proposed to link a multilateral
trade agreement to the Aspen IDEA Principles as stated in a reference paper 
At the fourth Aspen IDEA Plenary Session in November 2011 IDEA staff
offered a thought experiment” aimed at generating ideas about implementation 
In the ensuing discussions and deliberations there was strong agreement on the
need for a multistakeholder governance process There was also spirited discussion
on whether there was a need for any connective tissue ” i e a way to coordinate 
in any respect the collection of existing and future multistakeholder entities A
consensus on coordination did not develop by the time that the IDEA Project
reached its end Several aspects of the thought experiment” appear below and
other forums in the coming years will need to pursue the quest for means to implement
principles into practice 
The Aspen IDEA Project Participants and Process
The Plenary Sessions and Working Groups benefited enormously from the participation
of a broad range of corporate civil society foundation and government
representatives The government representatives did not join the Working Groups;
but they gave generously of their time and expertise in the Plenary Sessions and
Project staff consulted with them throughout the process 
The Project was funded by and owes particular gratitude to the following foundations 
the Markle Foundation John S and James L Knight Foundation Ford
Foundation and the John D and Catherine T MacArthur Foundation In particular 
Stefaan Verhulst of the Markle Foundation deserves special thanks for his
support insights and day-to-day participation in the process However financial
support of the Project does not imply the funders  agreement with any particular
statement made in this report 
American and European companies from every digital industry segment
were instrumental in the development of the Aspen IDEA Common Statement
8 Toward a Single Global Digital Economy
and Principles and they provided valuable insight into implementation issues 
Similarly civil society participants from the U S Europe South America and Asia
were vital to the process The Project benefitted greatly from the input and advice
of key government officials and agencies from six countries plus representatives
from the European Parliament and the European Commission More specifically 
in addition to the EU representatives officials from the following countries
and agencies contributed to the effort Canada—Canadian Radio-Television
and Telecommunications Commission; Denmark—National IT and Telecom
Agency Danish Ministry of Science Technology and Innovation; France—Conseil
Stratégique des Technologies de l Information and Office of the President of
France; Netherlands—Ministry of Foreign Affairs; Sweden—Ministry of Foreign
Affairs; United States—Department of Agriculture Department of Commerce
(NTIA) Department of State Federal Communications Commission Executive
Office of the President including National Economic Council and the Office of
Science and Technology Policy Office of the United States Trade Representative 
and the President s Intelligence Advisory Board 
The Project built on the prior work of Jonathan Aronson of the University of
Southern California; Peter Cowhey of the University of California San Diego;
and Donald Abelson who in 2009–2010 convened a group of firms to discuss
global Internet issues outlined in their book Transforming Global Information and
Communication Markets The Political Economy of Innovation (MIT Press 2009) 
They joined with Aspen IDEA Chairman Reed Hundt Managing Director and
General Counsel Gary Epstein Charlie Firestone Shanthi Kalathil Melanie Hart 
Sarah Eppehimer David Hansen and Kate Aishton to guide the process 
A representative list of the Aspen IDEA Project participants that attended one
or more of the four Plenary Sessions is included in the appendix to this report 
In addition to those listed the Project also benefited from the work of additional
representatives from the companies and civil society in the working groups 
However participation in the Project at any one point does not necessarily reflect
agreement by a participant or their employer of any particular statement in this
report Rather the report reflects the Project staff s sense of the group 
Portions of the Project s work product are included in the appendix to this
report 
• The Aspen Institute IDEA Project Framework Paper
• Internet Freedom A Background Paper Shanthi Kalathil
• Privacy Standards in the Digital Economy Enhancing Trust and Legal
Certainty in Transatlantic Relations Remarks by Viviane Reding
• The Role of Public Authorities in Cloud Computing Remarks by Neelie

The Report 9
• The Cloud Unleashing Global Opportunities Remarks by Julius
Genachowski
• Remarks Given at the Aspen IDEA Plenary Washington D C Reed Hundt
• Cross-Border Information Flows and Digital Trade Principles
• Plenary Participants
The deliberations over principles began at the initial meeting in Washington 
D C in October 2010 The discussion was aided by reference to the Framework
Paper included in the appendix The Framework Paper analyzed fundamental
changes in today s global markets affecting the Internet and related international
communications systems It then explored choices for collective action to achieve
the Project s goals stressing the critical need for cooperative leadership in the face
of proliferating threats to the culture of the Internet 
The participants discussed and formulated topics for further deliberations 
There was a strong emphasis and focus on market opportunities Most recognized
that Internet freedom is an inextricable part of the debate Market freedom and
personal freedom were generally recognized as complementary values although
subject to careful definition 
After the initial meeting IDEA formed five working groups (1) Promoting
Innovation and Access—Market Opportunities; (2) Publishing in an Open
Internet; (3) Network Device Application and Service Interconnection; (4)
Cloud Data Control and Sovereignty; and (5) Values and Methods of Information
and Communications Technology (ICT) Innovation Corporate and NGO representatives
chaired the working groups and moderated the calls which were
also facilitated by IDEA staff The discussions were spirited and productive After
several months of weekly calls and meetings each group produced a report These
reports were compiled into a single working document for the January 2011 Los
Angeles Plenary Session 
At the Los Angeles Plenary Session each Working Group Chair presented a
draft set of principles set forth its underlying rationale and led a group discussion
on the issues Each of the working groups focused on ways to promote the single
global digital market within the context of their specific working group charter 
In order to narrow discussion toward the goal of specificity the Los Angeles participants
recommended that the principles be tested discussed and analyzed in the
context of cloud computing  Ambassador William Kennard U S Ambassador
to the European Union stressed the importance of bringing European companies 
civil society and European Union (EU) government representatives into the
Project 
10 Toward a Single Global Digital Economy
Building upon the Los Angeles efforts and on Ambassador Kennard s recommendation 
IDEA staff and participants recruited additional European representatives 
With expanded attendance the third Plenary Session was held in Brussels
in late March 2011 At that meeting the IDEA staff presented a revised version
of the principles in a Discussion Paper The Paper used cloud computing as a
test case As part of the Project s incorporation of more European perspectives 
European Commission Vice Presidents Neelie Kroes and Viviane Reding and
Deputy Director General for Information Society and Media Antti Peltomäki set
forth a European approach to the Project s issues Representatives from Brazil and
India civil society also participated in the Brussels plenary session Afterwards the
original five working groups expanded by new European participants re-formed
into a trio of new working groups focusing on (1) market access (2) free flow of
information and (3) trusted environment issues In addition each of the three
new Working Groups was asked to help formulate portions of an Aspen IDEA
Common Statement The Common Statement was intended to be a general
articulation of the three working groups  more specific delineation of principles 
The working groups continued after the March 2011 Brussels Plenary Session 
This was an especially eventful time Many of the Project s participants were
involved in the E-G8 meeting in Paris in May 2011 Many were also part of an
OECD High-Level Meeting in Paris in June 2011 The former revolved in general
terms around the core issues debated in the IDEA Project The latter led to the
promulgation of principles discussed in detail below that could be described as
“in dialogue” with the Aspen IDEA Principles 1
Taking these events into account Aspen IDEA set the fourth and concluding
Plenary Session in Washington D C for November 2011 There the staff presented
the Aspen IDEA Common Statement and Principles As a result of dialogue
at the Plenary Session the Principles were amended and are published below The
Washington Plenary Session also generally debated and discussed Internet governance
issues and specifically discussed a means to implement the Aspen IDEA or
other principles 
The Internet freedom agenda was at all times an inextricable part of the Aspen
IDEA process In the first Washington D C Plenary Session the staff presented a
paper on Internet freedom (see Appendix) 
As the Project continued it was thrilling and instructive to watch the 2011 Arab
Spring unfold in large part on the common medium of the Internet Even though
the denouement of the Arab uprisings lies in the future already these events have

The Report 11
echoed in Russia and other countries A central argument of the Aspen IDEA
Principles is that governments should support and extend Internet culture not
curtail it 
In 2010 and 2011 United States Secretary of State Hillary Clinton delivered a
series of three speeches on Internet freedom In them she outlined both the benefits
of an open and secure Internet and the consequences of failing to live up to
those ideas One of the purposes of the Project was to strengthen and apply those
ideas In her trilogy Secretary Clinton made it a tenet of American policy that the
United States in concert with other governments will promote the Internet as a
single global platform State Department representatives Alec Ross and Ben Scott
forcefully presented Secretary Clinton s policies in all of our meetings 
A central argument of the Aspen IDEA Principles is that
governments should support and extend Internet culture 
not curtail it 
In January 2010 Secretary Clinton began the presentation of her views by stating
that The spread of information networks is forming a new nervous system for
our planet  But she stated these technologies can be used to undermine human
progress and political rights  She described a spike in threats to the free flow of
information  Then Secretary Clinton said that the United States stands for a single
Internet where all of humanity has access to knowledge and ideas  She likened
this position to the First Amendment and to Franklin Roosevelt s Four Freedoms
speech in 1941 She then expounded on the Internet s capability to provide access
to knowledge and potential markets” and thus to create opportunities where
none exist  She said Disruptions in these demand a coordinated response by all
governments the private sector and the international community  She called for
a global freedom to connect 2
Secretary Clinton s second speech on February 15 2011 responded directly to
events in the Arab Spring 3 She described the Internet as the public space of the

21st century  She restated the importance of the freedom to connect ” and she
listed more threats to the exercise of that freedom She then asserted that liberty
and security … make each other possible ” and so both are necessary to the functioning
of the Internet She also called for both transparency and confidentiality”
in the Internet culture Finally she called for both tolerance and civility  Her
dualisms captured the balances the Aspen IDEA Principles tried to strike 
Her third and last speech in the series on December 8 2011 was a forceful
summary 4 She clearly explained network effects When ideas are blocked information
deleted conversations stifled and people constrained in their choices the
Internet is diminished for all of us  She called (as does the IDEA s implementation
proposal) for cooperative action…shared principles…[and ways] to navigate
the practical challenges of marinating an Internet that is open and free while
also inter-operable secure and reliable  Secretary Clinton said private companies
and users have to be part of governance while governments should not replace
the current multistakeholder approach which includes governments the private
sector and citizens and supports the free flow of information in a single global
network  She decried national barriers in cyberspace” and called for a truly
global coalition to preserve an open Internet 
Secretary Clinton s three speeches animated the IDEA effort in at least three
ways As she did the Project recognizes real threats to an open Internet including
acts by states and nongovernmental agents The Project enumerates principles that
should be shared by all those who connect to the Internet—a new modern basic 
global freedom And the Project s participants began to outline practical mechanisms
to use multistakeholder governance instead of state control as the method
to assure for everyone the manifold benefits of this single global medium

The Report 13
The Aspen IDEA Common Statement and Principles
The Aspen IDEA Common Statement was formulated and refined between
the Brussels Plenary Session in March of 2011 and the second Washington D C 
Plenary Session in November 2011 It is a prologue to the more specific principles
for the IDEA Project In our view the Common Statement should be adopted by
all participants in the global Internet and it is very much in accord with the prevailing
culture of the Internet The Common Statement and Principles collectively
constitute The Aspen IDEA Principles 
The Aspen IDEA Common Statement
All elements of a digital economy and society should be bought sold 
created or experienced in a single seamless global market of goods 
services and ideas over broadband infrastructures that operate in a
dynamic commercial environment 
All information should be transferred across any and all national
borders as senders and receivers should wish Any restrictions resulting
from measures taken by governments to safeguard public policy principles
should be proportional transparent equitable necessary provided
for by law and consistent with international treaties or best practices
on privacy security protection of intellectual property rights and free
expression Commercial agreements and voluntary arrangements may
go beyond measures taken by governments but should be compliant
with applicable law relevant international treaties and best practices 
The seamless global transfer of information and exchange of digital
goods and services should occur in a responsible and accountable
trusted environment that guarantees the interests of national and personal
security the right of individuals to privacy and the interests that
individuals and firms have in rights of property and rights of access to
information association and free expression 
14 Toward a Single Global Digital Economy
The Aspen IDEA Principles
The Aspen IDEA Principles fall into three clusters those that strengthen
the Internet infrastructure and promote free trade in the Internet s ecosystem 
those that enhance the international free flow of information and those that
promote a trusted environment for the Internet 
A Strengthen the Internet Infrastructure and Promote Free Trade in the ICT
Ecosystem
1 Governments should foster a pro-competitive policy environment
and promote investment including cross-border investment in the
facilities and services supporting the Internet infrastructure and
expansion of the Internet as rapidly as possible 
2 Governments should expand the Internet by encouraging competition
in broadband access and other relevant markets In light of
the growing importance of broadband mobile networking governments
should commit to embrace the following policies 
a Maximize the availability of spectrum through continual
improvements in spectrum policy 
b Assure technology neutrality in the design of the wireless
network and its devices 
c Subject to competition policies permit commercially
determined approaches to the intersection of the wired
and wireless segments of the Internet space 
3 To permit suppliers of communications infrastructure to participate
fully in the ICT ecosystem and thus fuel investment in that
infrastructure governments should commit to these actions 
a Redefine the relevant market for networked consumer
information to provide nondiscriminatory treatment of
telecom carriers particularly in regard to privacy requirements
for how they handle customers  electronic data 
b Continue to rely on flexible market-based frameworks for
network pricing traffic policies and interconnection in
order to maintain an open and interconnected Internet
ecosystem subject to the reasonable oversight of competition
authorities 
The Report 15
4 Governments should expand the capability of the Internet to
increase trade and adopt policy measures designed to maximize free
trade in all aspects of the ICT ecosystem 
5 To encourage trade and innovation in services and software governments
should 
a Allow IP-based and converged services (e g cloud computing
and environmental services) to enjoy maximum
regulatory flexibility and to be subject to regulatory obligations
only to the extent that they are narrowly tailored to
the dynamics of this rapidly evolving sector 
b Reinforce policies that support technology neutrality 
including promoting digital product neutrality for applications
and software 
6 As the range of ICT applications expand in the economy and society 
and the salience of these applications to important rights and
needs of citizens increases new policy interventions are needed in
ICT markets Governments should make best efforts to advance
“regulatory coherence” among national policies with major impact
on ICT markets including by creating internal government mechanisms
to promote coherence To do so governments should publish
annually a list of planned future measures that impact ICT goods
and services 
B Free Flow of Information Principles
1 Governments should allow the free flow of information globally 
a Allowing information to move freely and be stored globally
permits the capture of economies of scale and makes it
possible to reap the economic benefits associated with the
Internet 
2 Governments should not artificially or geographically restrict facilities
and information storage 
a Artificially limiting the location of data geographically
reduces the resiliency of the Internet and undermines its
stability 
b Governments should not require that facilities or information
be located in a specific country or region 
16 Toward a Single Global Digital Economy
3 Other Protections 
a Freedom of expression as defined in international treaties
on human rights should be preserved 
b Any government restrictions on content should be transparent 
necessary provided for by law and consistent with
international standards on free expression and privacy 
c Governments should provide to information on the Internet
the same protection from government access as information
stored locally or housed in any other environment 
d To encourage the online dissemination of services and
content governments should offer providers appropriate
intermediary safe harbors to shield them when hosted
content or software is alleged to violate a law or infringe on
third party rights including intellectual property rights 
C Creating a Trusted Environment
1 Global Internet policy and practice must promote a functioning
“trusted environment” with respect to issues such as security; privacy;
intellectual property rights; protection of children consumers
and personal data online; and free expression All stakeholders
should recognize government civil society and private sector needs
for security of the Internet 
a Governments should implement clear transparent and
impartial laws including due process protections and reasonable
notice to govern requests for third party information
stored by Internet providers 
b Governments should develop fast efficient methods for
gathering and sharing information regarding fraudulent
and deceptive commercial practices that can victimize
consumers through the Internet and the means to deter 
detect and prevent such practices 
c Governments should develop policy requirements that
make certain that consumers  personal data is portable 
Such policies should provide consumers with reasonable
access to their own data gathered by suppliers about
that user s conduct on the Internet (e g records of
past purchases) and personal information submitted to
The Report 17
Internet-based applications (e g personal health information
stored on a web-based application for personal health
monitoring) 
d Governments have an obligation to assure that the private
sector maintains enhanced consumer protection 
i Internet providers should transparently explain their
information handling practices and the regulatory
needs of their server locations with respect to such
issues as data protection and privacy 
ii Internet providers should disclose requested third-party
information only to the extent required by law and 
to the extent permitted by law should provide affected
customers with reasonable advance notice of any such
compelled disclosure 
iii Governments should work to create a level playing
field and achieve global interoperability on privacy
and data protection principles by basing privacy rules
on globally recognized principles (such as the OECD
privacy guidelines) and by extending mutual recognition
of laws that achieve the same objectives Privacy
rules should also consider fundamental rights such as
freedom of speech freedom of the press and an open
and transparent government 
e Governments should enforce intellectual property rules as
they relate to the Internet and the ICT ecosystem 
f Governments should ensure clearly defined legal rights
and a robust and fair process to protect rights including
users  rights consistent with the need of governments to
enforce applicable law Governments industry and civil
society should work together to foster respect for the rule
of law defined here as a system of transparent predictable
and accessible laws and independent legal institutions and
processes that respect protect promote and fulfill human
rights 
g Governments should implement internationally recognized 
market-driven security standards and best practices
to promote cybersecurity while simultaneously ensuring
that the framework conditions ensuring an open Internet
are not disrupted 
18 Toward a Single Global Digital Economy
Discussion and Analysis of the IDEA Principles
Rights and Obligations
The Aspen IDEA Principles (the Common Statement plus the specific Principles)
are a combination of positive and negative liberties or rights They assert powers
to use the Internet that are inherent for all people These include the capability to
send and receive information anywhere in the world across all national boundaries
and to all individuals subject only to commonly understood prohibitions
against criminal activity Internet users also should have the capability to form
associations participate in networks and express themselves freely Similarly the
Principles envision as positive liberties the use of the Internet for entrepreneurial
activity the process of creating and capturing value in commercial activities on the
single global digital economy and the capability to market and sell on the common
medium 
By describing the Aspen IDEA Principles as positive liberties the project
intended to state that firms and individuals in every country should be able to
share in the economies of scale and network effects These multiply exponentially
(Metcalfe s Law) as the Internet increases in the number of participants both animate
and inanimate 
Some contend that Internet access and web participation are not fundamental
rights The Aspen IDEA Principles presuppose that as McLuhan wrote decades
ago the medium is the message”—or in other terms in the digital age no one
can exercise to the fullest such rights as free expression and innovation without
being able to be part of the Internet community Economic political and technological
barriers to that participation are not to be tolerated 
The Principles also include negative liberties statements of what individuals 
firms and nation states should not do If its governance limits these negative acts 
the Internet can evolve in an expanding open space of creative action and technological
innovation Advances in microprocessor price and performance fiber and
radio wave connectivity and data storage and retrieval have already permitted the
Internet to host and to distribute goods and services in degrees of scale and scope
that were unforeseen even a few years ago Unplanned and unpredicted innovation
abounds in the common medium although governments acting alone and
in concert may assist in assuring various positive liberties According to the IDEA
Principles these enumerated negative liberties should prohibit governments from
accidentally or intentionally creating harmful barriers to the open innovative evolution
of the Internet 
The Report 19
Categories of IDEA Principles
The Aspen IDEA Principles fall into three broad categories mirroring the
working groups market access free flow of information and trusted environment 
These categories are mutually supporting Each is indispensable to ensuring
Internet freedom and function 
The Market Access category focuses on connectivity guiding the creation and
maintenance of the physical networks on which information flows The Principles
in this category allow market forces to guide the expansion of these networks and
for these networks then to open markets as a whole This market focus means
adopting technologically neutral policies Consumers should determine what
goods and services win the day 
The Principles include a bar against governments discriminating among telecom
carriers in imposing privacy requirements Governments also should not impose
any restrictions on IP-based and converged services such as cloud computing In
general governments need only preserve the status quo of flexible market-based
frameworks as in the case of network pricing traffic policies and interconnection 
including the choice of access and application technologies and service providers 
treatment of traffic Many participants at the November 2011 Plenary Session in
Washington vigorously stated this point Because of the growth of broadband
mobile networking governments should maximize available spectrum through
both licensed and unlicensed modes of use Commercial markets not regulators 
should determine what devices and network solutions will exploit that spectrum 
As technologies change the Aspen IDEA Principles will need to change in application 
However the Principles are sufficiently robust that they should provide a
precedent-based system of governance Moreover the Principles should promote
cross-border investment in Internet infrastructure They should also encourage
fair trade policies that maximize the social and economic benefits produced by
technological innovation 
The Free Flow of Information category contains the Principles that capture the
role of information (or data) as a positive force for both commerce and human
rights This category s Principles address two main issues the geographical storage
of data and the protection of free expression and privacy Regarding data location 
policymakers must ensure that national sovereignty and regional agreements do not
create barriers that threaten the security and resiliency of transnational networks 
… policymakers must ensure that national sovereignty and
regional agreements do not create barriers that threaten
the security and resiliency of transnational networks 
20 Toward a Single Global Digital Economy
As stated in the Principles governments should remove rules that limit the
geographical location of data storage facilities They should void regulations that
undermine the stability and resiliency of the Internet Subjecting data stored in foreign
facilities to different regulations from those imposed on locally stored data produces
similar effects to outright bans The Aspen IDEA Principles reject such rules 
To protect privacy and free expression governments should offer information
exchanged online the same protections as information in any other environment 
If governments wish to impose restrictions on information to protect against
criminal behavior or to serve some other social purpose any such regulation
should be transparent part of the overall rule of law and consistent with international
norms 
To encourage the exchange of services and content online service providers who
facilitate those exchanges should not be burdened with the obligation to interfere
with those exchanges Further they should not face liability for providing a common
medium any more than manufacturers of printing presses or a newsprint
seller should be responsible for what someone publishes on paper Reasonable
intermediary safe harbors are necessary to shield providers against allegations
that they are hosting illegal content Governments can create an environment in
which information flows freely without asking service providers to be censorious 
Businesses can best exploit economies of scale and reap the economic benefits of
the Internet if service providers are not asked in effect to act as agents of government 
This approach however is not intended to condone rationalize or protect
those who do violate the rule of law consistent with international norms 
All participants in the Internet ecosystem including service providers recognize
the importance of content The attendant rights of content owners are discussed
below in the Trusted Environment category Discussions of the appropriate balance
between trusted environment and free flow of information concerns were an
important aspect of the Aspen IDEA dialogue However the participants were not
able to reconcile intellectual property and intermediary safe harbor issues and the
discussion will need to continue in other forums 
The Trusted Environment category contains the Principles that focus on the
vital government and private interests needed to protect the Internet from misuse 
while preserving vital rights of free expression Tackling a broad range of issues
that has attracted increasing attention in recent years this category s provisions
are grouped into those aimed primarily at protecting privacy and those aimed at
preventing the creation online of activities commonly regarded as criminal 
Protecting privacy online requires both protecting the rights of consumers and
controlling the actions of service providers Consumers should have access to and
control of the personal data they submit or that service providers collect regarding
their actions online To achieve this end service providers must be transparent
The Report 21
about their practices regarding consumer data limit their disclosure of personal
data to third parties to those required by law and inform consumers of necessary
disclosures whenever possible 
Rules governing third-party requests for information like all rules in the desired
Internet governance system should be clear transparent and impartial They must
be administered with due process and reasonable notice provisions 
Coordinating policies across national boundaries will further protect consumers
and enhance efficiency Therefore governments should build their rules
around internationally accepted privacy principles such as those established by
the OECD 5 They should extend mutual recognition of laws that differ in form
but achieve these same goals 
Without safety from fraud abuse and theft commerce and civil society cannot
continue to thrive on the Internet To keep users safe governments should implement
internationally recognized market-driven cybersecurity standards They
should attend to best practices and enforce existing intellectual property rules 
Developing fast efficient methods for gathering and sharing information when
violations occur will also help governments respond to existing problems and
deter others in the future These actions should all be taken with due consideration
of user rights and acknowledgment of the right of free expression Government 
industry and civil society should cooperate to assure that all parties respect the rule
of law and freedom of information 
The IDEA Principles aim to create a sustainable 
vibrant digital environment for…social and economic
development 
These three categories form a coherent set of fundamental guidelines for
enhancing the Internet s capacity to create economic growth and improve quality
of life Without resilient and accessible infrastructure information has no path to
individuals and businesses Without freely accessible information infrastructure
lacks value to those users Without trust that these networks are safe for lawful
expression and commerce users  generation and use of information will diminish 
The world then would be culturally economically and politically poorer The
IDEA Principles aim to create a sustainable vibrant digital environment for the
magnification of the possibility of social and economic development

22 Toward a Single Global Digital Economy
Comparison to Other Internet Principles
The Aspen IDEA Project s efforts to develop fundamentals of good international
Internet governance were complementary to other initiatives in 2011 A
compilation and comparison of several such efforts is included in the appendix of
this report 6
Some such as the White House s Cybersecurity Proposal 7 focused on important
but comparatively narrow policy areas Perhaps the process most closely resembling
the Aspen IDEA Project was the government-sponsored OECD process The OECD
Principles were carefully negotiated in a multistakeholder process and unveiled in a
laudably open high-level meeting in Paris 8 Civil society representatives balked at
endorsing the OECD Principles but many companies were supportive Expressed
in a cautious tone the OECD Principles reflected an inter-governmental perspective 
but one that emphasized a light touch with regard to regulation 
The Aspen IDEA Principles reflect somewhat greater focus on transparency in
nation state regulation of the digital economy They have a somewhat more prescriptive
tone They focus more than the OECD on cross-border data flows and
on trade issues 
The OECD Principles looked to future multistakeholder efforts for defining the
limits of intermediary liability The IDEA Principles instead call now for governments
to create appropriate intermediary safe harbors to shield service providers
from liability for innocently transmitting content that infringes on a third party s
rights 
A system to improve government response to online fraud and deception is
present in the IDEA plan but absent from the OECD Principles as are recommendations
for empowering consumers to gain access to and control the information
collected about them online The OECD Principles also make no mention
of placing privacy protection requirements on service providers while the IDEA
Principles call for Internet service providers (ISPs) to disclose their privacy practices
to consumers and to limit the disclosure of consumer information to third
parties to the greatest extent possible 
In general the IDEA Principles explicitly enumerate that which governments
should not do Governments should not require that facilities or information be

located in a specific country or region End users should be able to access data
across borders Data centers are efficiently located where power is relatively cheap 
weather conditions permit natural cooling and fiber access to the global networks
is ample and inexpensive These efficiencies cannot be achieved in many nation
states But the benefit of accessing and storing information in such data centers can
be enjoyed by everyone—as long as nation states do not interfere with the transfer
across borders of data from such centers to users located anywhere in the world In
this and other respects the Aspen IDEA Principles aspire to translate technological
innovation into sound policies for every nation 
The normal caveats of criminal sanction must apply no one wants data centers
to be havens for lawbreakers But underlying the Aspen IDEA Principles is the
concern that national efforts to require data to be sited within national boundaries
may lead to the denial of market access or limit citizens in some countries from
full use of the Internet 
This topic alone will attract much discussion debate and detailed deliberation
in years to come Some nations will want to tax cross-border transfer of data 
Some will want to impose privacy rules on firms that store individual data and by
doing so oblige firms to create data centers within the boundaries of any nation
in which they do business Others may want to deny access to national markets for
firms that want to offer software platform or infrastructure as a service The IDEA
Principles express disapproval of all such initiatives while explicitly endorsing the
power of governments to protect their citizens from illegal activity through the
medium of the Internet 
In spirit and in objective the Aspen IDEA Principles and those emerging from
the OECD are consistent Both of these statements have much more useful detail
than other efforts have produced Most importantly they both endorse multistakeholder
governance This represents a dramatic departure from the way telecommunications
and media historically were governed nationally and internationally 
Use and Limitations of the Aspen IDEA (and Other) Principles
Principles alone may be insufficient in the absence of an enforcement mechanism 
Various governments still contend that nation states must regulate the
Internet to preserve its benefits and preclude its use by bad actors They suggest
that without the attentive bureaucracies and enforcement authority of government 
the Internet will devolve into chaos These governments describe a choice 
give up the flexible dynamic bottom-up evolution that has allowed the Internet to
become a major feature of the social and economic landscape or watch it dissolve
into a swamp of lawlessness The Aspen IDEA Project rejected this pessimistic view
of multistakeholder governance under guiding principles There are at least three
benefits to widespread agreement as to principles and to their continued development
through the multistakeholder processes 
24 Toward a Single Global Digital Economy
First any firm group or individual can use these Principles as a guide to selfdirected
behavior The more detailed the principles the easier for a single firm
to align its conduct with the prevailing practice An initially loose coordination
around principles could evolve into a self-organizing coherent cognizable code
of good behavior—without requiring that any government put the code into
law 
Second anyone accepting the Principles can cite them as support for action
challenged by others If a company is shut out of markets because of national
regulations requiring storage of personal data on local servers it can point to the
IDEA Principles on market access in its petition to the authorities for relief If a
government requests that a company remove content that the company believes
falls within the boundaries of free expression that company can cite IDEA
Principles on the free flow of information to justify its refusal to comply It is far
from unusual in international law to refer to norms and codes of conduct as part
of governments reaching reasoned conclusions about right acts 
Third the IDEA Principles can be adopted by any nation state or multistakeholder
organization as a regulatory paradigm or a charter for collective action 
Their scale scope and genesis are robust enough that nations and organizations
need not repeat the process by which they were generated Instead beginning
with the Principles nations and organizations then could choose to tailor them to
address specific problems in specific situations 
The IDEA Principles can be adopted by any nation state or
multistakeholder organization as a regulatory paradigm or
a charter for collective action 
However unendorsed principles do not readily lead to mutual accountability
among diverse actors When Egypt severed all of its Internet connections and shut
down its cellular services in response to political protests in January 2011 9 it probably
would have been ideal if a multistakeholder body had convened to mobilize a
common response It would have been useful if a multistakeholder group s charter
obliged that participants frame a response If the firms that effectively operated
the Internet in Egypt had endorsed the Aspen IDEA Principles they might have
been aware that complying with the instructions of the Egyptian state put them in

conflict with what they had endorsed That might have led them to discuss ways to
oppose collectively the demands of the Egyptian state They could have said (with
the strength of numbers) if the government of Egypt terminated Internet traffic 
they must collectively and publicly state their opposition 
By contrast when a government singles out a firm as a danger to the state it
is extremely difficult for it to respond in any way other than by obedience to the
demands of the accusatory state The individual firm may depend on a government
license to do business Its employees and business partners may be at risk if
the firm does not submit to the state And any single firm may face the prospect
that the accusing state can elevate a commercial rival into a superior situation if
it does not comply with whatever demands are made While Google tangled with
China over banned search terms the Chinese search company Baidu profited
immensely at Google s expense in the Chinese search market 10 When a critical
mass of firms has endorsed the Aspen IDEA Principles however an attack on one
may be deemed an attack on all A single firm then could call on all signatories to
declare support for the IDEA Principles If they did act collectively the state might
find that it had more to lose from the resistance of all firms than it could gain by
bending the single firm to its will 
Next Steps—What Is Left to Do
There is still work to be done on the Aspen IDEA Principles Progress should
be made in the areas of consistency across other statements of principles more
precise classification of principles clearer details and broader explicit consensus 
Consistency The Aspen IDEA Project recognized that the time was not ripe
for a full agreement The participants were pressed for time The parties were still
divided on important issues and the Principles will need to evolve in tandem with
technological and political circumstances The Aspen IDEA Principles will benefit
from deeper analysis and comparison with the larger ecosystem of Internet-related
principles Various stakeholder groups in both the private and public sectors are
regularly proposing new sets of principles Mapping the areas of convergence and
conflict among these sets will make clear where challenges remain and where the
path for progress is clear 
Classification The Principles would benefit from separation into finer categories
for application to specific circumstances Those addressing more high-level
ideas should serve as general guides to the policy process and will remain relevant
for years to come Narrower more specific directives will provide clearer direction
for implementation These more specific principles probably will require more

frequent revision as technology and circumstances change Drawing lines between
general and specific principles analogous to the demarcation between statutes and
regulation will increase the value of both 
Clarification Some areas of the Principles require more deliberation For example 
to achieve closure in the Trusted Environment category the Principles need
a more complete policymaking guide Stakeholders in the global digital economy
also must further develop national security privacy and intellectual property principles 
Avoiding such issues will lead to less consensus around the other principles 
Consensus Ultimately the IDEA Principles need strong widespread support
by the Aspen participants and from others that were not around the Aspen IDEA
table It is particularly important to involve those from all sectors outside the
United States and Europe Either by acts of individual leadership or by a collective
multistakeholder process a broad consensus is necessary Indeed if parties in the
Aspen IDEA Project do not lead the refinement and consensus-building process 
they may find that suboptimal principles emerge as normative practice in the
Internet ecosystem (Such unfortunate behavior occurs all too often in commons 
whether an ocean of water is the example or an ocean of data is the case in point )
Moreover the Aspen IDEA and OECD Principles and other competing principles
in global discourse need support from relevant NGOs and by the overwhelming
majority of nations NGOs are numerous but many are inadequately or intermittently
funded Foundation or corporate support probably will be required to allow
many NGOs to participate fully and effectively in multistakeholder forums NGOs
are inconsistently invited to participate as equal participants in relevant processes 
especially NGOs based in developing countries Many of them represent important
points of view but if their presence is not robust and continuous or if they are
not able to commit some constituencies to concrete principles their views may be
unheard or dismissed too easily Yet NGOs are central to the genesis and governance
of the Internet If the NGO role is to remain as constructive as it has been historically 
relevant parties should strengthen NGOs through inclusion and financial support 
The lack of binding participation in principle formation by most nation states 
particularly in the developing world is difficult to address without invoking the
presence of existing bodies like the United Nations or its authorized extensions 
such as the International Telecommunications Union (ITU) But the principle of
multistakeholder governance by definition denies control of the Internet to the UN
or the ITU even if these venerable organizations were to seek such authority over the
Internet Voluntary government participation can produce important and widely
attended events like the Internet Governance Forum in Nairobi in 2011 but a reliable
method to ensure widespread government participation still needs to be found 
The Report 27
Issues of Implementation of Principles
Statement of Problem of Implementation
The goal of the Aspen IDEA Project was to engage governments business and
civil society in the design of principles and in the development of a governance
system that would fairly and efficiently implement them The threats described
below are real and cannot be ignored Thus in addition to the development of the
Aspen IDEA Principles an underlying theme throughout the course of the Project
was the search for a way to implement them through a multistakeholder entity
(“MSE”) model of Internet governance To pass muster the resulting governance
structure needs to be able to effectively resolve hard cases that deviate from generally
accepted principles 
…governance by MSEs acknowledges the right of
everyone—companies civil society and governments—
to participate in the policy-making process… 
The participants understood the importance of the implementation issue It was
the focus of the November 2011 Washington D C Plenary Session From the start 
the Project explored trade-based solutions that could be embedded in a broader
agreement on national policies and their implementation The Aspen IDEA participants
recognized that a trade-only solution was unfeasible Thus the Project
considered existing and evolving forms of multistakeholder Internet governance 
Simply put the governance by MSEs acknowledges the right of everyone—
companies civil society and governments—to participate in the policy-making
process related to issues with which they choose to be concerned However the
MSE concept is vague (to a degree purposefully so) lacks operational clarity and
leaves open many questions What are the respective roles of the various actors 
Should governments be an active participant in the process  What procedures
should be used  What are the binding or enforcement mechanisms that need to be
in place  These and other questions were debated during the course of the Project
and elsewhere 11
To some MSE governance is inadequate It can seem like democracy to those
who do not favor democracy but it smacks of technological colonialism to those
who vividly recall imperialist subjection The open transparent nature of MSE

governance has few supporters among the unelected or undemocratically elected 
governmental leaders who assert sovereignty over most of the world s people 
Still there is a recognized body of law and practice on MSE governance Several
examples exist in the Internet area Even though no single comprehensive set of
MSE practices exist and no vote was taken certain parameters emerged 
…the only plausible Internet governance plan includes
both government and nongovernmental agents 
First technological advances do not necessarily produce positive results for
humanity As Secretary Clinton explained in detail collective human action is
essential for the Internet to deliver good outcomes 
Second the only plausible Internet governance plan includes both government
and nongovernmental agents Government has a necessary role in vindicating
various rights and seeking certain sound outcomes Nongovernmental actors
operate the Internet create value on its platform and at a bare minimum address
transborder issues that no single government can manage 
Third outcomes matter If the Internet culture cannot solve the problems of
market access property rights and individual freedom then its governance must
evolve to produce solutions The test of effective MSE governance is its results 
Alternatives to Multistakeholder Governance
As the Internet s effect on commerce and individuals continues to grow nation
states are showing increasing interest in asserting their jurisdiction over it A legitimate
and important role for governments must be defined partly to enhance the
capability of the Internet to affect the world for good instead of ill and partly to
establish appropriate limits on governmental action The line must be drawn with
special care in the areas of privacy security and the protection of property rights 
In the absence of a positive plan negative initiatives might proliferate 
…in the absence of a positive plan negative initiatives
might proliferate 
For example China Russia and other nations are pushing for the establishment
of a more formal international management system for the Internet They may
The Report 29
want to house such a function in the United Nations 12 India with the support of
Brazil and South Africa has suggested the creation of a United Nations Committee
for Internet-Related Policies reporting directly to the UN General Assembly and
run by the organization s staff and using its funding 13 Despite a mixed response
from other authorities these three nations have vowed to bring Internet governance
under broader state control 14
A venue for the debate of such proposals is the ITU World Conference on
International Telecommunications in late 2012 The ITU proposes that nations
will renegotiate the International Telecom Regulations (ITRs) The United States 
position supported by other like-minded governments is that only minor changes
should be made to the ITRs The ITU s Secretary-General has stated that a substantial
expansion of the treaty s scope is necessary 15 Given its existing treatybased
authority over digital networks the ITU governed by its member states is
unlikely to adopt multistakeholder governance as the central method to guide the
future of the Internet 
Further the ITU World Conference could seek actions that run counter to the
Aspen IDEA Principles the OECD Communiqué16 or any other widely accepted
statement of operational conducts and values Russia China Tajikistan and
Uzbekistan set forth their own proposal for Internet norms before the United
Nations General Assembly in September 2011 This International Code of Conduct
for International Security” does support some goals shared by the United States and
other nations favoring an open Internet such as protecting critical infrastructure 
But it pushes for information security” to curb any action that undermines other
nations  political economic and social stability as well as their spiritual and cultural
environment 17 This proposal is distinctly not consistent with the Aspen IDEA
Principles If the Russia-China policy becomes a part of the Internet s culture the
impact on international human rights and digital commerce could be devastating 
Until recently conflicts over culture and governance of the Internet were largely
hypothetical But in the past decade challenges to the seamless and open Internet
proliferated China s restrictions on Internet traffic are bold and at odds with the

of websites based outside of China that are trying to enter the Chinese market 
including Facebook Twitter and Skype 18
Even governments that usually support the free flow of information sometime
diverge from the Aspen IDEA Principles Riots in London in early 2011 prompted
the United Kingdom s prime minister initially to blame Twitter and Facebook for
facilitating disorder He floated their suppression as a means of preventing future
riots 19 The EU is apparently considering imposing restrictions on data storage
location that in practice may create market access limitations on cloud computing
in Europe And in August 2011 San Francisco Bay Area Rapid Transit authorities
shuttered mobile-Internet and phone service in an attempt to quash a demonstration 
The FCC is now investigating this issue 20
State actors also threaten security The United States Congress recently alleged
that China and Russia are responsible for cyber-espionage campaigns against
American companies 21 Government incursions on the basic structure of the
Internet impede the free flow of information and reduce the safety of conducting
business online These threats to the Internet culture s survival are likely to become
more frequent in the absence of both a wider base of support for the Principles and
a greater consensus of opinion around multistakeholder governance 
…threats to the Internet culture s survival are likely
to become more frequent …
Consideration of Trade Agreements as an Internet Governance Mechanism
The Aspen IDEA Project began by seeking consensus around a trade agreement
that emphasized market access for broadband at the hardware software and content
levels (see the Aspen IDEA Framework Paper in the appendix ) The notion was that
by means of a trade regime the Principles could be exported into the economy and

national legal regime of every signatory country A single digital economy would
emerge It would promote respect for rights of property privacy and security as
well as human rights and would utilize an existing enforcement regime This aspiration
was based in large part on the success of the WTO Basic Telecom Agreement
of 1997 Under this precedent a multilateral trade agreement could be linked to
behavioral principles stated in a reference paper This technique was endorsed by
a former United States Trade Representative in the Project s final plenary meeting 
Agreement on a trade agenda failed to materialize in the IDEA Project for at
least two reasons First a global trade agenda was severely hampered by the worst
economic downturn in decades Neither business nor government could mobilize
the will to take action in this new topic area at such a trying time 
Second even as threats to a seamless Internet gathered strength globally competing
and unharmonious perspectives emerged within the United States concerning
the reach of domestic jurisdiction over even the physical platforms that
underlie the workings of the Internet A successful trade agenda depends on an
underlying consensus on both a regulatory framework and an implementation
process That has not yet happened Moreover some Aspen IDEA Project participants
thought that the lack of consensus domestically about Internet governance
meant that the United States could no longer serve as the undisputed demander”
and leader in global negotiations After all the Internet is global today and therefore
many nations alone or in coordination could lead trade-based approaches
to addressing the need for governance However in the last few years Europe
has become even more riven by political disharmony than the United States As
a result no country or region has successfully assumed the role of leader in setting
an aggressive global trade agenda for the digital economy or even specifically
sought to champion market access for Internet firms 
Nevertheless trade remains a fruitful means for supporting the open Internet 
Trade agreements can combat both traditional roadblocks to commerce and
newer threats that could cause more damage to the digital economy Tariffs and
regulatory barriers such as interconnection rules restrictions on foreign ownership
of networks and limits on investment in infrastructure deleteriously affect
the Internet and these barriers are traditional subjects of trade negotiations New
technical barriers to trade present a particular threat to the Internet Among other
issues differing technical requirements for the same equipment and services prevent
firms from introducing new goods and services to improve the platform 
Trade regimes have enforcement mechanisms that multistakeholder governance
lacks Trade can also have an important influence on the development of
the digital economy The principles that undergird trade decisions can become
norms that guide nation states  domestic governance laying a foundation for
future decisions 
32 Toward a Single Global Digital Economy
Perspective of Current Trade Officials High-level trade officials were active
participants in the Aspen IDEA Plenary Sessions Miriam Sapiro Deputy U S 
Trade Representative and Christine Bliss Assistant U S Trade Representative 
provided valuable background and advice at the Plenary Sessions They stressed
that recent initiatives are attempting to integrate the global trade regime with the
Internet 
For example multiple efforts have addressed protection of intellectual property
rights internationally The Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights
(TRIPS) set rules applying intellectual property law to all members of the WTO
as part of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) in 1994 In 1996 
the WTO signed an agreement with the World Intellectual Property Organization
(WIPO) to encourage broader understanding and implementation of TRIPS
and other Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) rules including technical support 22
More recently the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA) has provided
additional support with its current participants including the new addition of
Russia 23 representing more than half of global trade in goods 24 Bilateral agreements
have also bolstered the effectiveness of IPR initiatives Nearly all U S bilateral
trade agreements created in the last decade contain requirements that both
nations sign key WIPO treaties 25
Regional organizations have adopted rules extending support of free digital
trade beyond where broad multilateral consensus is possible The Asia-Pacific
Economic Cooperation (APEC) established in 1989 has made progress on
Internet and technology-related issues APEC s 2005 Privacy Framework establishes
standards similar to OECD standards previously set on the topic with the
important inclusion of China and other nations that have caused concern over
treatment of user data 26 The group continues efforts to coordinate more coherent
policymaking among its 21 member nations 27
Bilateral agreements have also made some progress in the digital economy

The Report 33
Preferential Trade Agreements (PTAs) between individual nations allow governments
to settle issues on which broader negotiations fail to reach consensus such
as the application of other WTO rules to digital transactions PTAs have provided
a venue for experimentation with new terms pushing forward the development
of e-commerce-related terms The United States has spearheaded this approach 
negotiating agreements with a number of key partners that include provisions
for everything from improving domestic regulatory processes to removing location
requirements for online suppliers 28 Other nations have similar agreements
enacted or pending demonstrating the influence of these laboratories” for innovative
trade solutions 29 A United States agreement with Korea is a recent example 
breaking down technical barriers to trade settling intellectual property enforcement
questions and establishing momentum for further change in the region 30
Other newer initiatives are being pursued to update trade relationships harmonize
trade rules on a global scale and strengthen enforcement of existing rules For
example in November 2011 President Obama announced that nine nations had
agreed to a firm outline for the Trans-Pacific Partnership a forward-looking trade
agreement among Australia Brunei Chile Malaysia New Zealand Peru Singapore 
Vietnam and the United Sates The agreement builds upon the work of APEC covering
all sectors of the member nations  economies but saving special focus for ICT 
Current work between the United States and the European Union is leading
to new options for trade discussions concerning the digital economy The
Transatlantic Economic Counsel (TEC) the organization behind the Internetbased
trade principles discussed above is pursuing ongoing projects on innovation
policy and intellectual property protection Leaders of the United States and the
European Union met in November 2011 to issue a directive for TEC to establish
a High Level Working Group on Jobs and Growth focusing on tech-driven
emerging sectors 31 A new forum under TEC the Transatlantic Innovation Action
Partnership (TIAP) is using multistakeholder discussions between top-level government
representatives and technology experts to break down barriers in the trade
of raw materials necessary for production of new technologies and to increase communication
about geographic areas where innovation is flourishing 32 Although all
market sectors are not covered these initiatives promise to strengthen the already
strong trade relationship between the United States and the European Union

34 Toward a Single Global Digital Economy
Another important area of progress in trade is the enforcement of existing
agreements Digital commerce has been a leading source of compliance controversy
in trade Enforcement of TRIPS-consistent laws rather than the establishment
of those laws is the central problem in intellectual property rights protection 33
In recent years digital trade and the Internet have been among the leading causes
of service-related WTO disputes 34 The United States has also taken advantage of
WTO rules allowing enforcement pressure without formally filing a dispute In
October 2011 the United States sought detailed information from China on the
impact of Chinese policies that may block American companies  websites Given
the importance to American businesses of online access to the enormous Chinese
market ensuring that China acts in accordance with related GATS provisions is
crucial The GATS contains a provision requiring China a WTO participant to
respond promptly to the request 35 Without making sure that key participants are
following trade rules there is little point to setting them in the first place 
Limitations of a Trade Solution Although trade negotiations continue to
attempt to ease digital commerce among nations certain aspects of the traditional
trade system limit their effectiveness These issues have historically prevented trade
from addressing the full spectrum of challenges facing international commerce
and civil society Overcoming them is an important challenge for policy makers
and stakeholders 36
Trade agreement structures leave room for gaps and exceptions that hamper
their effectiveness Gaps can be created by the need for consensus as negotiating
parties avoid certain topics or willfully ignore controversial issues Because
governments are bound only to the final agreements they sign these gaps lead
to uncertainty even if other countries have committed to certain behaviors Even
after parties agree to basic terms exemptions built into agreements provide more
exceptions for countries not interested in committing to full compliance Both
the GATS and TRIPS contain articles that allow a country to avoid treaty provisions
that violate the country s public morals ” but neither document contains
adequate explanation of what that term means 
Another issue is the national security exception present in every trade accord 
By shifting goods and services into the military category nations can avoid bans

The Report 35
on tariffs and industry subsidies 37 ICT industries where new technologies are
likely to have defense as well as civil applications may be more vulnerable to such
potential tactics Using these gaps and exceptions countries can avoid conforming
to broadly accepted principles of Internet governance while still technically
complying with trade agreements 
After entering an agreement and navigating multiple exceptions a trade agreement
provision must also deal with enforcement and compliance problems The
WTO s Trade Policy Review Mechanism regularly reviews the trade policies of
member nations and requires nations to offer explanations for inconsistencies 
However the process offers only transparency and does not lead to enforcement
of rules against violators Cases often drag on for years before any sanctions are
issued (notwithstanding major reforms to the system in 1995) 38 Ultimately the
significant power that countries have to enforce WTO agreements and dispute
settlements is the threat of retaliation by imposing additional trade barriers This
tit-for-tat tactic leaves smaller nations who lack economic force behind their
policy threats with little protection at all 39 Yet there are many small nations for
which access to a single global digital economy is especially valuable 
A history of tension between trade agreements and human rights further
complicates this system The WTO is not a human rights organization and its
agreements do not explicitly reference human rights 40 Historically there has been
conflict between human rights and agreements in several areas of trade and that
conflict continues in such areas as intellectual property Human rights advocates
have made TRIPS and other treaty provisions key to the ICT industry the subject
of significant critique 41 Human rights also interact with trade agreement exceptions
in ways that further complicate enforcement 
These drawbacks or limitations of a trade regime are not new nor are they likely
to be resolved in the near future The trade regimes should help sustain a single
digital economy However ensuring that nations act in accordance with all desirable
principles likely will require more mechanisms for implementation than the
trade arena provides

Solving for Multistakeholder Entity (MSE) Governance
Advantages and Disadvantages Whatever their membership goals and decision-
making structures different Multistakeholder Entities (MSEs) have similar
advantages and disadvantages Multistakeholder governance can embody democratic
processes in a way not practically possible in any governmental system 42 By
shifting control away from a top-down system in which a single authority sets agendas
and provides the final word on solutions MSEs facilitate dialogue about institutional
priorities Because MSEs permit all ideas to be advanced they can encourage
more creative solutions to problems Their flexible structures and lack of bureaucratic
formality can allow them to bring debates to conclusion with dispatch 43
But MSEs are self-organized; they do not necessarily have legitimacy respect or
persuasive power They may lack financial and other resources Participants may
not necessarily represent all stakeholders whose interests are implicated in an MSE s
decisions Organizers may not find a good balance between the inclusion of all
stakeholders and the need to deliver consensus Organizers who lack authority may
find that their judgment calls are influenced by the need to avoid criticism from
one party or another 44 In some MSEs the stakeholders with the greatest influence
on decision making are also the parties that the resulting rules or principles are
intended to govern In these cases questions of accountability arise particularly
when procedural controls may not be as strict as in other governing bodies 45
Because MSEs permit all ideas to be advanced they can
encourage more creative solutions to problems 
Some governmental bodies have also begun to question MSEs  source of
authority over the Internet arguing that without formal cooperation with government
entities they cannot exercise legitimate power over Internet policy making

Current MSE Initiatives Several of the MSEs that have helped define the
Internet from its inception continue to shape its evolution What is now a structure
of independent entities began as an amalgam of small boards and advisory panels
created by the United States government to oversee management of the Internet 
In 1992 members of these groups who reside in many countries founded the
Internet Society (ISOC) a not-for-profit organization in order to host a continuing
discussion of the Internet s legal political economic and social implications 
ISOC provides an overarching legal and fiscal structure for the groups that directly
manage the Internet s functioning 47 Under ISOC the Internet Architecture Board
(IAB) is in charge of the technical and engineering development of the Internet 
overseeing work by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) and other task
forces 48 Together the multiple MSEs functioning under ISOC form a network of
linked organizations each with specific responsibilities for guiding the Internet s
everyday functioning 
Of the MSEs the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers
(ICANN) has one of the longest track records dating back to the 1990s ICANN
originally was a creation of the United States government but has expanded its
board and procedures to be a more international body It oversees new Internet
domain registrations and IP addresses within those domains In November 2011 
the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) the
Department of Commerce s expert on Internet governance announced that the
contract giving ICANN authority over the domain name system would be open
to competitive bidding It is unlikely that another organization would be able
to match ICANN s resources and expertise closely enough to win the contract 
However NTIA and Commerce want ICANN to be more responsive to the government s
requests for information and to provide more reasoned and thorough
explanations of its decisions 49
Started in 1994 the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) also provided early
technical guidance for the Internet The organization now has offices around the
world and members from businesses universities governmental entities and civil

society groups as well as interested individuals W3C does face challenges and criticism 
Stakeholders have raised concerns about the organization s effectiveness in
keeping standards up to date 50 Some believe the balance of power in its decisionmaking
process needs to be altered 51
A newer generation of MSEs has begun to address other areas One relatively
new participant in the field the Internet Governance Forum (IGF) has dramatically
expanded participation in the international discussion over the Internet s
future In 2006 the United Nations established the IGF in response to a 2005
report from the World Summit on the Information Society (WSIS) The IGF s
central body is its Multistakeholder Advisory Group (MAG) made up of 46 representatives
from government business and civil society and in which all members
participate in equal standing IGF s dynamic coalitions ” addressing specific
issues of concern such as privacy and linguistic diversity generally allow participation
by any interested individual The Forum s annual meetings have generated
unprecedented participation from citizens around the world More than 2 000
participants attended the 2011 meeting in Nairobi Kenya 
Part of the reason the IGF has succeeded in fostering free dialogue about
Internet governance may be its disinclination to seek policy-binding consensus 
This may also be one of the IGF s major limitations The lack of pressure to negotiate
binding rules allows freer communication and the inclusion of many stakeholders
otherwise not included in the Internet governance process but it may not
be an adequate way to implement key Internet-related principles However the
IGF has demonstrated a significant soft power” ability to define key issues and
shape norms among the diverse parties it draws to the conversation 52
The Global Network Initiative (GNI) is an international multistakeholder effort
at safeguarding freedom of expression and personal privacy against government
restrictions In 2008 Microsoft Yahoo and Google announced the creation of
GNI 53 GNI s initial mission was to create core documents laying out principles

implementation guidelines and an accountability plan to ensure that its members
act in support of human rights worldwide 54 Despite two years of active collaboration
among representatives from business government academia and civil
society the resulting documents have received mixed responses GNI continues to
work on issues at the intersection of human rights and the Internet requiring and
reviewing reports from its member companies seeking new members and supporting
research on new topics 55
Even as entities such as the IGF generate broad discussion of new issues more
focused expertise and labor may be required to make policy progress in specific
areas The Broadband Internet Technical Advisory Group (BITAG) seeks to fill
that gap for the issue of network management By convening committees of
technical experts to address the appropriateness of specific actions by companies
that affect online traffic flows BITAG seeks to create certainty in a specific area of
Internet policy BITAG s scope is intentionally narrow and United States-focused 
at least for now 
As the current MSE landscape demonstrates many gaps in Internet governance
cry out for their own MSEs such as in the areas of privacy and cybersecurity 56
In order to focus the discussion on Internet governance in the November 2011
Plenary Session the Aspen IDEA staff presented an idea labeled a thought experiment ”
for implementing the Aspen IDEA Principles through MSE governance 
The Staff Thought Experiment  The Aspen IDEA proposal had two basic
design principles (1) respecting national sovereignty (hence the proposal did not
depend on trade treaty-based governance) and (2) maximizing the use of expert 
pragmatic and efficient MSEs for accomplishing many of the goals of regulation
and standard setting The building blocks of the staff proposal were MSEs called
“subject matter multistakeholder organizations” (SMOs) The SMOs would engage
in setting standards and guidelines for behavior certify companies as complying
with national policies certify countries as having national policies that comport
with the Principles and reach reasoned conclusions on any disputes brought to
them The staff proposal recognized a need for connective tissue ” i e the concept
of mutual recognition among the SMOs The MSEs discussed above would be
examples of some necessary SMOs but they would need to define their goals with
54 Global Network Initiative Core Commitments ” Accessed March 16 2012 http //www globalnetworkinitiative

55 For example a report containing recommendations for companies and users regarding control of content
in online services by GNI members the Center for Democracy and Technology and the Berkman Center for
Internet & Society grew out of a GNI event on the topic Erica Newland Caroline Nolan Cynthia Wong and

more precision in order to fit within the framework advanced by the staff 
As an example of such precision an SMO might certify a company as complying
with the policies of a particular government That country as a participant in the
SMO would treat such a certified company just as it would treat all other companies
in its jurisdiction In short it would adhere to a nondiscrimination principle 
There would be no limit to the number and variety of SMOs The network of
SMOs would expand and evolve with technology and society They would each
adopt the Aspen IDEA Principles as part of their charters Thus the Principles
would become connective tissues” across all the SMOs 
Although a central governmental body may struggle to create a new bureaucracy
covering an emerging network technology in a short period of time such
an SMO system would avoid delays and costs by allowing experts and interested
parties in new areas to form bodies to recommend regulatory approaches saving
time and resources Additionally SMOs exist outside of the daily political
wrangling of individual governments making them easier for companies NGOs
and even other governments to trust as independent evaluators 57 Due to that
independence governments may also be more willing to learn from SMOs rather
than from larger political actors Whatever the specifics of its implementation a
governance system for global digital communications based on SMO knowledge
and independence could reap enormous rewards for nations worldwide and the
citizens and companies they represent 
…a governance system for global digital communications
based on SMO knowledge and independence could reap
enormous rewards for nations worldwide and the citizens
and companies they represent 
Under one variation of the thought experiment ” governments would each
enter into an identical contract with a unique SMO called a Protocol Certification
Organization (PCO) The PCO itself would be an MSE funded by companies 
foundations and contracting nations The PCO would foster financially support
and assure the reasonable performance of various expert international multistakeholder
organizations each organized around one or more of the subject matter
57 One example of an SMO-like” body successfully operating in another field is the International Accounting
Standards Board See www ifrs org 
The Report 41
topics addressed by the Principles The PCO would rule on the reasonableness of
any SMO s decision making if asked to do so The PCO would report its decision
to the public and to all the contracting governments 
Advocating the MSE Model Despite MSEs  expertise and history of Internet
management their control over Internet governance is increasingly under threat 
They are not adequately prepared to defend themselves or to demonstrate their
efficacy There is no single central set of principles and structure for their efforts 
That is one reason to suggest that all adopt in common the Aspen IDEA or similar
Principles MSEs are already re-litigating the same issues using precious resources
redundantly Nor is there a mechanism to foster collective action in interdependent
areas of concern 
There was no consensus among the IDEA participants on whether any more
“connective tissue ” vertical or horizontal or both should be created Some
are optimistic that MSEs will evolve in appropriate ways to satisfy the concerns
described in this report That may be true but any evolution needs to occur quickly 
because the dangers to the Internet s present and future development are real
and urgent Moreover important decisions need to be taken in the near future 
Generally plan beats no plan ” as U S Treasury Secretary Geithner famously said
in the most critical moments of the financial crises of 2008–2009 
In considering what plan is preferable the Aspen IDEA Project identified at
least the following attributes as important for any MSE Internet governance structure
to be useful 
• Adherence to principles either IDEA s or a reasonably comparable version
• Open membership and participation
• Open processes
• Reasoned deliberation and explanation of decisions
• Acceptance of a willingness to be challenged and to have to explain processes
to other forums
• A dispute resolution mechanism
• A statement of purpose (standard setting codes of conduct topical focus 
and so forth)
• Support including financial for the continuous and well-informed participation
of civil society in sufficient form and number to accommodate
that amorphous but vibrant community within the Internet s broader
community
• An enforcement mechanism
42 Toward a Single Global Digital Economy
Stress Testing the IDEA Principles and MSE Governance
The test of any set of principles even if all MSEs adopt them is whether they
solve problems that most all agree need solving This section applies the Aspen
IDEA Principles to four real world situations The stress tests focus on the application
of the SMO concept to specific cases 
The Case of WikiLeaks
WikiLeaks is an international nonprofit media organization that publishes secret 
classified and confidential information primarily from government sources The
organization released documents embarrassing to the governments of Somalia 
Peru Kenya and other nations in 2006 But its international notoriety exploded in
2010 when it released a series of documents from United States military and diplomatic
sources These releases included video of a United States helicopter attack
on apparently unarmed Iraqi civilians and cables by State Department employees
criticizing world leaders The Department of Justice commenced an investigation 
Political pressure mounted Several major companies who provided services to
WikiLeaks including Amazon Apple PayPal Visa and MasterCard terminated
their relationships with the organization Some media and human rights organizations
also criticized WikiLeaks for failing to redact information that could harm
Afghan civilians serving as informants and other innocents Supporters at other
publications and groups however welcomed the release of the information and
established mirror sites to keep the documents available online 
How should governments businesses and other participants in the global
digital marketplace have approached this thicket of thorny issues  The Aspen
IDEA Principles provide guidance Under the Principles governments must balance
preservation of freedom of expression as defined in international treaties on
human rights with the need to preserve cybersecurity and national security Above
all any government actions regarding WikiLeaks and other online publishing of
information must be transparent necessary provided for by law and consistent
with international standards on free expression and privacy 
In the WikiLeaks case an SMO could have struck the balance the Principles
call for Such an SMO might have included for-profit firms and NGOs It might
have concluded that WikiLeak s conduct had gone too far toward disclosure of
information without considering sufficiently the national security and personal
safety concerns involved In that case the SMO would have declared WikiLeaks
to be unwelcome in the Internet community and thus would have legitimized
the refusal of certain important firms to provide the platforms necessary for
The Report 43
WikiLeaks Such a process would have created a clear precedent and would
have extended the rule of law to a troublesome but important fact situation 
Governments then would benefit from the creation of clear and internationally
standardized rules for responding to situations like WikiLeaks in the future a task
that SMOs could help accomplish 
The Case of Internet Privacy
In 2010 the Wall Street Journal investigated the use of tracking technologies and
discovered that the top 50 sites worldwide each placed an average of 64 trackers on
visitors  computers The Journal revealed that data-collection companies tracked the
behavior of children collected geographic location information via mobile devices 
used deep-packet inspection to identify users across multiple devices and compiled
detailed dossiers on private individuals using social networking résumé government
and other sites among other potentially distressing developments These
practices along with evidence of similar actions intensified the call for new privacy
rules either from industry self-regulation or by means of legislation or both 
The IDEA Principles regarding consumer protection and privacy speak to
these issues Specifically these actions by private companies revealed by the
Journal may be contrary to the IDEA Principles  emphasis on public sector directives
to maintain enhanced consumer protection including limits on third-party
information disclosure and respect for international standards of data treatment 
Under MSE governance the facts would be established in an open forum 
…a specific code of conduct…would allow legitimate
business practices to proceed [and] assure individuals that
they could maintain reasonable expectations of privacy as
to their use of the Internet 
Private and public sector parties would work toward a specific code of conduct
that all relevant firms should follow This process if successful would allow
legitimate business practices to proceed while at the same time it would assure
individuals that they could maintain reasonable expectations of privacy as to their
use of the Internet 
44 Toward a Single Global Digital Economy
The Case of Google in China
Google began offering a Chinese version of its website in 2000 but the venture
soon faced challenges Two years later an investigation revealed that Chinese
Internet service providers were heavily filtering Google s results slowing or blocking
access for China s 250 to 500 million Internet users With users flocking to
Google s competitor Baidu a Chinese search engine Google agreed to filtering
requirements demanded by the Chinese government in order to operate as
a licensed company in the country In 2009 a cyberattack known as Operation
Aurora mined proprietary information from Google s networks This was part of a
larger series of attacks that experts suspect were carried out by the Chinese government 
Google continues to operate the Chinese version of its site with government
approval but the governmental restrictions prevent Google from offering the value
of its search engine in competition to Baidu and new competitor GoSo cn owned
by one of China s state-run media organizations 
China s actions implicate the IDEA Principles relating to the free flow of information
and trusted environment The Principles require that any government
restriction on the free flow of information online including filtering of content be
transparent necessary provided for by law and consistent with international standards
on free expression and privacy  The Operation Aurora attacks also violate
the Principle s directive to respect the privacy of individual users and do not meet
the need for clear transparent and impartial laws including due process protections
and reasonable notice” needed to preserve a trusted online environment in
regards to privacy Finally the Principles recommend the creation of international
standards for cybersecurity a measure that could prevent future attacks 
SMOs may not have direct enforcement power but they do have the ability
to influence international opinion and help build consensus Here SMO actions
could have drawn attention to freedom of expression issues worldwide An
SMO on cybersecurity also could have significant impact on public opinion By
encouraging collaboration between technical and security experts governments
and businesses such an SMO could facilitate the setting of security standards
and policies to prevent identify and react to cyber-attacks quickly and effectively 
SMOs may not have direct enforcement power but they do
have the ability to influence international opinion and help
build consensus 
Such an initiative would require significant financial and other resources but
those investments would pay large returns in the safety of individual privacy and
The Report 45
industry secrets Perhaps the most effective response SMOs could orchestrate
would have been a collective refusal by the global Internet community to connect
China to the rest of the world—even for a limited time period This ostracism
might have had salutary effects 
The Case of China s Indigenous Innovation Policies
The Chinese government has developed a strategy for indigenous innovation”
that it hopes will allow Chinese companies to surpass current leaders in the United
States EU and Japan in ICT and other technology innovations A set of guidelines
created in 2006 encouraged Chinese government agencies to promote domestic
innovation companies through preferential procurement discriminatory standardization 
tax incentives and financial support for research and development
(R&D) Holders of intellectual property interests in other nations have been particularly
concerned about China s encouragement of assimilating absorbing and
re-innovating” foreign technologies into Chinese companies 
First several Principles relating to market access speak against China s protectionist
actions Giving Chinese companies advantages through discriminatory
procurement and standards setting fails to preserve technological neutrality in
ICT and related markets Second respecting intellectual property rules in the ICT
ecosystem is key to creating the trusted environment described in the Principles 
China s assimilation” of technologies patented by parties in other nations may
violate various international agreements governing intellectual property use 
Existing and new SMOs could play a key role in addressing these and similar
“indigenous innovation” policies Standards-setting organizations including the
IETF and other examples of multistakeholder entities in the ICT sphere should
maintain influence over standards so as to prevent discrimination against foreign
companies and fragmentation of technology markets Cooperation with the international
trade system can reinforce existing agreements and point to areas where
additions to agreements can make significant impacts in trade areas A strong
“name and shame” regime generated by SMOs can draw attention to these and
other discriminatory policies increasing pressure on nations to comply with common
principles or risk retaliation and isolation SMOs focusing on intellectual
property might even offer expert opinion in judicial proceedings 
…respecting intellectual property rules in the ICT
ecosystem is key to creating the trusted environment
described in the Principles 
46 Toward a Single Global Digital Economy
These examples raise some of the hard cases any Internet governance system
will face But hard cases lead to good practices as opposed to bad law In hard
cases MSE governance can be the optimal way to build broad collective cooperation
in framing responses Hard cases can exemplify why MSE governance is
preferable to more legalistic solutions and certainly to indifference or inaction 
Conclusion
The challenges to creating a single global Internet are large and growing Annual
ICT revenues now exceed $4 trillion and the ICT industry accounts for a high percentage
of new high-skilled jobs worldwide Failure to address in a timely manner
the fundamental flaws that threaten to cripple and fragment the Internet s growth
and its seamless nature are major issues that need to be addressed now 
The grand political battles in the United States and Europe over budget deficits
and economic issues the existence of unsustainable trends across geopolitical
regions and the rapid spread of the Internet s related technologies all heighten the
importance of the Aspen IDEA Project effort to promote policies among governments
to ensure a robust global and seamless Internet Ensuring that the voices of
NGOs and firms with distinctly different priorities are considered only makes the
task more difficult For example differences between Internet edge companies and
content firms over intellectual property and the free flow of information entered
often into the discussions making compromise on key policies and approaches
difficult to resolve The time was not yet ripe for agreement 
The Principles recommendations and implementation efforts of the Aspen
IDEA Project may never be embraced in full or by all relevant stakeholders 
Indeed time and new technological change will make some of the details outdated
before they can be discussed negotiated and agreed upon Still the Aspen IDEA
participants who gave so generously of their knowledge and time have enabled
the Aspen IDEA Project to offer a valuable start towards what is needed The ideas
of IDEA set forth in this report are intended as a valuable stepping stone to a successful
Internet future 

Ten Principles of the Web

The Internet is a set of equipment means of transmission protocols computer programs data and information that connected to each other establishes a big net on planetary scale But the magic that fascinates us all is known as the Web a set of services allowing to open documents located anywhere in the globe and through hyperlinks to navigate around pages with a wide range of content – videos images effects – and interact in social networks So we can define the web as a mean to expose reference and link All in digital network 

The Web also takes the risk of becoming a zone of disputes closing corporate and proprietary services invasion of privacy This W3C Brasil contribution the Ten Principles of the Web” is an invitation to reflection so we can reach consensus around principles and guidelines in order to keep the Web as an open and universal platform The Web for all requires a debate from all parties involved 

WEB FOR ALL 

The main value of the Web is the social value The Web is more than a technological environment is an environment of human communication business transactions and opportunities to share knowledge These Web contents should be available to everyone regardless of hardware software network infrastructure culture geographical location physical or mental skills socioeconomic status or education level of each individual 

WEB IN EVERYTHING 

The number of devices able to access the Web grows steadily This is not the environment suited to desktop computers anymore We can navigate via cell phones digital TVs cars and even through home appliances This comprehensiveness requires the Web content to provide the possibility of being accessed from any of these devices including remotely or while in motion 

WEB ORGANIZED BY STANDARDS 

Standardization means create a universal environment where everyone could know what to do how to do it and where they could be able to do it That´s why the standards should be opened internationally accepted and discussed in organizations that could host all those interested in developing the Web assuring the independence of providers and proprietary technologies Standardized and publicly documented specifications are critical for the freedom of publishing Web content and to provide the continuous and steady keeping of those contents 

ACCESSIBLE WEB 

Ensure persons with visual hearing mobility and mental impairments or any other disabilities the conditions to understand navigate interact and develop themselves in the Web environment are a prerequisite for the Web to evolve into a universal inclusive design Inclusion must also reach the new generations and the elderly taking into account the required education to generate new digital competences   

RELIABLE WEB 

More than transform the way we communicate the Web changed the nature of our social relations The Web is an environment with new meeting places Business transactions and personal relationships often take place without personal meetings The confidence in the Web is directly related to the full right of freedom of speech research and navigation by adopting new technological standards and models that assure the users privacy and safety  

WEB WITH MULTIPLE AUTHORS AND READERS 

The Web is more than a reading and researching environment As a communication tool it allows everyone at any time and from anywhere to share knowledge Provide Web contents isn´t a one-way action anymore Nowadays Web publishing is the meeting point where the hyperlinks with multiple authors interact Keep this architecture and adopt universal standards are also a guarantee of the Web´s diversity 

WEB TO SERVE DEMOCRACY 

The Web went beyond the stage of a gigantic document collection Nowadays it is a set of referenced services and data reused and combined in many applications for different purposes The access to open data especially public government data enables the interaction between citizens and community and between community and government in its many spheres and instances Ensure the free development of applications on Web based on open data is nowadays one of the pillars of a democratic society 

WEB FOR SOCIOECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT 

The wide use of the Web with e-commerce and e-government best practices fosters the local economic development Extend those benefits to the different social layers particularly those in need or in remote places through digital inclusion policies and the use of mobile technology resources will provide solutions that will increase the access to public health education and assistance services 

WEB THAT PRESERVES ITS MEMORY 

Defining strategies and policies to select contents in order to preserve the Web´s memory the biggest information repository created by the human kind will enable the future generations to access the culture depicted on the Web and will make it feasible as a subject of study and research plus contributing to the Web´s evolution  Resources must be dedicated to the preservation of the Brazilian Web and its memory in all aspects of its culture 

WEB OF ALL 

The universality and diversity of the Web must be sustained and deepened through the governance of the Brazilian Internet carried out based on a democratic transparent and pluralistic model where the participation of different sectors of our society is ensured  A governance that is also guided by the principles of collaboration collective creation ethics and human rights

The Tunis Agenda of the second World Summit on the Information Society (WSIS) defined Internet governance as the development and application by governments the private sector and civil society in their respective roles of shared principles norms rules decision-making procedures and programmes that shape the evolution and use of the Internet "

 

 

 

Within this context as supporters of the civil society we are working on subjects related to the privacy and protection of personal data in the digital society 

 

 

 

In this regard it is essential to emphasize the need to define principles and rules that are accepted by all actors in the information society for a good governance of the Internet 

 

 

 

Indeed it is generally admitted that the Internet is a potentially necessary engine for the development of our world a world we would like to be better more united and more just Today the Internet has turned into a universal space for communication and exchange an instrument for the promotion and defense of human rights It is a tremendous space for freedom in which all freedoms are present mainly political economic social academic etc 

 

 

 

However Internet can also be a medium for harmful acts and behaviors against the enjoyment of human rights Privacy attacks are increasingly more frequent particularly in regards to the abuse and disclosure of personal information 

 

 

 

All of this justifies as stated above the need to define principles and rules accepted by all actors for a good governance of the Internet 

 

 

 

Under the Internet governance principle definition process we propose the principles listed below which we consider are critical for an Internet where human rights and fundamental freedoms democracy and rule of law are acknowledged and respected towards a more free united and just world 

 

 

 

1 Principle of Acknowledgment and Respect of All Fundamental Rights and Freedoms

 

The entire Internet community and each individual stakeholder including the States should commit to the acknowledgment and respect of all fundamental rights and freedoms as part of the policies and activities carried out that are related to Internet 

 

 

 

States have the right and responsibility to define Internet public policies both at a national and international level To this end they must ensure full compliance of this principle whilst committing themselves not to violate the fundamental freedoms acknowledged within the relevant United Nations documents 

 

 

 

2 Inclusive and Participatory Governance

 

In order to achieve a good Internet governance all stakeholders should fully and accurately participate in the development of legal and institutional frameworks both at a national and international level 

 

Stakeholders should then pledge to respect the transparency and responsibility principles in each of their activities functions and competitions 

 

 

 

3 Digital Citizen” Participation

 

The principle of participation of digital citizens in the development of Internet governance public policies and mechanisms should be supported and respected by the States Digital citizens” must be able to exercise their fundamental rights and freedoms in an unhindered manner except for those stipulated by law 

 

 

 

4 Internet Universality

 

The Internet universality principle should be acknowledged and respected by all actors 

 

 

 

5 Security Principle

 

In order to achieve a good Internet governance the security principle means that all Internet actors and users can trust the integrity security and confidentiality of communication systems; that they can trust their communications will not be hindered intercepted or spied on 

 

 

 

6 Legal Principal

 

Any restriction to the use of Internet should be contemplated by the law No State or private company should adopt or apply measures that infringe the right to the use of Internet in the absence of a legislative act respectful of fundamental rights and freedoms and compliant to the corresponding clarity and accuracy rules 

 

 

 

7 Cultural and Linguistic Diversity

 

The cultural diversity principle should be acknowledged and respected by everyone This principle should support local content creation and promotion 

The Internet Governance Caucus (IGC) wishes to thank the organizers of the NETMundial meeting for the invitation to contribute to its proceedings through a written submission ahead of the meeting At this point in time the IGC is hereby submitting the following statement of a few fundamental principles to guide Internet governance processes and decisions  

 

1- Internet governance institutions and processes should be open and inclusive They should be bottom-up and consensus-based in their approach to policy development  Internet governance institutions and processes should be transparent accountable and enable the meaningful participation of all stakeholders 

 

2- All Internet governance decision making processes must ensure the inclusion of not just all stakeholders but also all regions of the world in an equitable manner As a result a special effort must be engaged in order to provide the Less Developed Countries with an equitable share of resources to participate in activities related to worldwide internet governance 

 

3- Any decision to evolve the internet governance institutional field and mechanisms as well as any new structure evolving from the current configuration of the implementation of the IANA functions and the role of US Government and of the other incumbents in that regard must reflect the effective inclusion of all regions of the world with a view to ensuring a truly global cultural diversity in approaches to technical and policy problems 

 

4- The technical community working on core protocols and technical standards of the Internet should seek a broad understanding of the societal implications of their design decisions and carefully weigh the advantages of the technological capabilities they are enabling against their potential adverse effects on individual users  freedom and liberties This should be done with a view to minimizing outcomes that continuously erode said freedom and liberties leaving the Internet user vulnerable to all sorts of abuse 

 

 

5 – Namely whether it is by virtue of technical design or by policy provisions on-line users must enjoy the same human rights as they are entitled to off-line 

6- There must not be discrimination in access and contents due to criteria such as opinion religion race gender geography language or economic resources 

7- Services offered in the internet must remain equitable and neutral among service providers without taking unfair advantage of a dominant or privileged position 

8- Internet availability deployment and service conditions must benefit all segments of the human society not just those enjoying richer economic development 

The Meeting which shall be held in Sao Paulo must offers some of basic principles and roadmap to build good environment for Internet Governance for all stakeholder in the world taking in

Consideration the freedom for expression opinion and equal of the accessibility for all stakeholder  IGF is official status It is the only official forum within the U N system to deal with -- which is specifically tailored for suggestion about public policies about Internet governance 

 

 PRINCIPLES

It is the broadness or potential broadness of our topics because according to the Tunis Agenda  IGF is mandated to discuss public policy issues on human rights as well as peace  security cyber security and privacy protection 

 

The exercise of human rights on the Internet is an issue of increasing interest and

Importance as the rapid pace of technological advancement and the constant evolution of

Pervasive digital mediums give rise to novel legal rights obligations and scenarios 

The Less Developed Countries must also be protected online and should not be held to different standards Therefore the human right for all people in the internet must be protected and secure so that everyone can feel secure and able to express about his opinion in easy way It s very important for the Democratically in the LDC s to find the right way to forward  so it need help because it s in the early stage of freedom and democracy 

 

The Citizens of Less Developed Countries should be able to send electronic communications to one another free from the fear of surveillance monitoring interception or any other violation of privacy Where interference is unavoidable for the purpose of security such interference must follow clearly defined processes as laid down by law as spams are always common 

 

We ask the Global Multistakeholder Meeting on the Future of Internet Governance to formally challenge the Tunis Agenda s definition of stakeholder ‘roles  by adopting the equal status  principle stated above We ask that the Meeting overtly recognize and defend the modifications of traditional policy making authority inherent in the multistakeholder model 

 

The advocates of this new principle recognize that there are numerous areas where the traditional role of the state is appropriate and necessary such as legislation and law enforcement in territorial jurisdictions Yet because so much of the policies and services of the Internet are transnational we believe that Internet governance must change their traditional roles and give all stakeholders the same status in the formulation of policy and encourage government participation from Less Developed Countries 

If we can be producing tangible results I mean the outcome of the discussions which IGF can develop in forms of non-binding opinions or recommendations or policy principles on all these topics as mentioned above  I believe the outcomes of IGF would be very useful to different sectors That would also raise the attractiveness of IGF

Capacity development and e-participation indispensable elements in the IG ecosystem

 

 Capacity development and e-participation are essential for achieving a legitimate and effective Internet governance ecosystem They can contribute towards ensuring genuine multistakeholderism by closing the gap between a sheer possibility to participate and the reality of being able to do it in a meaningful way 

 

The effectiveness and legitimacy of the Internet governance (IG) ecosystem depends on the individual and institutional capacity of actors to participate fully in global IG multistakeholder processes Capacity development should support and facilitate policy socialisation as a way to acquire the skills and understanding necessary to succeed in an IG environment with its high diversity of professional national and institutional cultures 

 

Capacity Development for Internet Governance (CD IG) should build on the capacity development achievements of ISOC DiploFoundation ICANN and ITU  among others CD IG aims to inspire and support change towards a new IG framework by 

 

·    moving beyond a simplistic view of capacity development as training towards a holistic approach (‘CD 360 ) involving institutional development coaching policy immersion and other interventions tailored for specific capacity development needs and environments;·    emphasising soft or social capacities including operational capacities (intercultural communication leadership organisational culture and values problem-solving skills) and adaptive capacities (ability to analyse and adapt change readiness and management confidence);·    ensuring local ownership of capacity development and considering local political social cultural and other specific conditions in developing and implementing capacity development programmes and activities;·    promoting openness to ‘lessons learnt  and flexibility to modify approaches as required;·    integrating capacity development within policy processes for example by providing ‘just-in-time learning  as a part of policy processes;·    introducing IG and related topics in the curriculum of academic post-graduate studies; ·    facilitating the emergence of an enabling environment where developed individual and institutional capacities can effectively address needs (legal framework and policies) 

 

 

Genuine and sustainable empowerment can be achieved thorough holistic capacity development on individual organisational system and network levels as it is visualised in the capacity development ‘butterfly  (methodology used by the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation) 

 

 

Figure 1 Capacity development butterfly

 

E/remote/online participation in global/regional policy meetings has evolved from an experiment to a proven method for inclusive participation IGF ICANN ITU among others have had a pioneering role in developing online participation in global policy making and this should now be institutionalised 

 

Online participation must now be offered as a standard method of attendance to all open meetings as a possibility for the inclusion of those without access to the requirements for in situ attendance (funding/time/other) An effective online participation should be an important criterion for evaluating the legitimacy and policy relevance of international meetings 

 

Online participation should be a standard part of event design as much as any other infrastructure specification such as Internet access or audio support for speakers  Online participation should be a fixed part of the budget for events International organizations should adjust procedures in order to facilitate effective online participation (e g role of chair effective moderation broadcasting translation in multiple languages real-time text captioning) 

Kuwait Information Technology Society (KITS) Submission on Internet Governance Principles and Roadmap for the further Evolution of the Internet Governance Ecosystem
NetMundial Global Meeting on the Future of Internet Governance
Sao Paolo Brazil 23-24 April 2014
Prepared by Qusai AlShatti
March 8 2014
Abstract 
Kuwait Information Technology Society (KITS) is pleased to provide its input for the NetMundial Global meeting on the Future of Internet Governance Sao Paolo Brazil 23-24 April 2014 KITS contribution on Internet Governance Principles provides a number of considerations to be noted and highlights a proposed list of principles KITS submission includes consideration addressing the Roadmap for the further Evolution of the Internet Governance Ecosystem 
Section 1 Internet Governance Principles
Internet Governance (IG) has become an increasingly important issue on global level since its introduction by the Tunis Agenda in the second phase of the World Summit on Information Society (WSIS) November 2005 The need for a principle based approach arises from many factors part of it are 
  The increase role of the Internet in our daily life 
  The Internet impact on the economic and social conditions 
  The Internet users high growth rate especially from the developing world and their demands 
  The need for improved Internet access 
  The different views of stakeholders groups from different regions of the world on matters related to IG 
Considerations on IG Principles 
1 It is important to agree on the definition of Internet Governance and set the principles in accordance to it Over the years many interpretations of what is meant by IG have been surfaced however we can say that the only working definition we have for Internet Governance is paragraph 34 of the Tunis agenda 
 the development and application by governments the private sector and civil society in their respective roles of shared principles norms rules decision-making procedures and programmes that shape the evolution and use of the Internet 
2
2 Internet Governance and the development of its principles is not only a global issue it is a national and a regional issue too We need to promote a principled based IG approach on all levels to unify our understanding of IG the Internet itself and the respective role of each stakeholder group 
3 The Issue of sovereignty and national jurisdiction and where or how they are applied in cyberspace need to be addressed 
4 Internet Governance principles should not be discussed or addressed as a reaction to incidents They should be addressed in terms of the evolution of the Internet to be a better environment and an improved resource to its users 
5 Different regions of the world different stakeholders groups and different cultures and societies have different priorities and concerns regarding the Internet Therefore It should be acceptable to have diverse sets of principles that are different from each other as long as they are developed with an acceptable conduct and as long as they preserve civil rights to an acceptable level Within that respect a global set of a high level IG principles are needed to be developed that is acceptable to all and that is considered the basic fundamental sets of IG principles to be followed by everyone 
6 Over the years efforts have been made to develop IG principles These efforts mostly were made by either an entity from a single stakeholder group or developed nationally as in the Brazilian model which is considered the only set of principles that is into effect today While these efforts can serve as a reference it is important that the development of IG principles especially on global level should involve a balanced global representation of all stakeholder groups from different part of the world 
7 The Universal Declaration of Human Rights the International Covenant on Civil and Political rights The Geneva Declaration of Principles and The Tunis Agenda should be the basis of any globally adopted Internet Governance Principles National efforts in this direction should reflect also civil rights as stated in national constitutions and legislations 
Proposed Internet Governance Principles 
1 Internet Governance is a multistakeholder process in nature Principles policy development and procedures related to IG should be all developed in an open inclusive transparent and democratic process with a balanced involvement and contributions from all stakeholder groups 
2 The Internet should be regarded as a public good for all Internet users and stakeholder groups They should all be empowered with the capabilities and resources that the Internet can offer to them 
3 The same rights applied to people Offline should be applied online This is should not only be led by The Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political rights but also by countries
3
constitution and national legislation The issue of sovereignty in this respect should be addressed 
4 All Internet users should be entitled to an equitable just and open access to the Internet Individuals with disabilities living in rural areas closed communities isolated geographical areas or belong to indigenous groups are all entitled to the same equal access 
5 Freedom of expression the free flow of information and open access to knowledge should be preserved to all Internet users 
6 Net neutrality and open standards development should be preserved and maintained 
7 Internet Governance should foster innovation create opportunities improve social and economic conditions in an equal manner to all Internet users Intellectual property rights should respected and protected 
8 Individuals  privacy and data protection measures in accordance with civil rights and states sovereignty should be respected Instruments to protect them from any type of violation should be established 
9 The Internet should preserve and promote cultural and linguistic diversity The Internet is a borderless place were cultures and people meet communicate and outreach Tools to foster and enrich local content should be promoted and encouraged 
10 Internet stability security robustness and resilience are crucial factors to establish user confidence and trust They are equally important to the economic and social evolution of the Internet Within this respect Internet Governance should ensure that proper instruments and actions addressing these factors are adequately addressed and implemented 
11 The day-to-day technical operation of the Internet is a privately-lead effort by the technical community independent from the influence of any single government 
Section 2 Roadmap for the Further Evolution of the Internet Governance Ecosystem
It is important in the first place to identify the organizations or platforms related to the Internet Governance Ecosystem This should be conducted in a neutral manner and an acceptable consensus on it should be reached 
4
It is further important that the initiation of any process related to the evolution of the Internet Governance Ecosystem should be multistakeholder in nature where every stakeholder group is engaged in equal footing to discuss all matters involved 
The Internet Governance Forum (IGF) has proved to be an effective independent platform to discuss issues related to IG Its global success has initiated and influenced many similar forums on regional and national levels This is an indicator of how the IGF became an effective tool to discuss Internet Governance issues Its open inclusive and multistakeholder nature contributed mainly to its success Its continuation at this stage of time is essential to all stakeholders groups However it is important at this stage to reconsider its format and outcomes in order for it to play a better role on global Internet governance issues and policy development 
The Internet is a global public good The Internet Eco System (including Critical Internet resources root servers domain names and addressing) requires a global model that is fair open transparent and accountable to the wide range of Internet users and involved stakeholders The global model should be based on the current existing organizations rather than establishing new legal structures or new umbrellas 
While the discussion on the evolution of the Internet Governence Ecosystem focuses on the globalization of the ICANN and the IANA functions It is important to address the status of other IG related organizations that are limited in its process to a specific stakeholder group Such organizations should be open to the equal participation of all stakeholder groups in any process related to the development of IG policies The ICANN should be praised for the steps it took over the past years to improve its bottom up process in policy development as well as its openness and engagement with many stakeholder groups in different regions of the world on issues related to Internet Governance and policies 
Yet further steps are needed toward the globalization of the ICANN and the IANA functions The globalization of the ICANN should include its status to become more of a global organization However more thoughts need to be given to the globalization of the IANA functions due to its technical nature and its vital role in the security and stability of the Domain Name System Future steps taken toward the globalization of the ICANN and the IANA functions should be evolutionary and should not affect the stability robustness and resilience of the Internet 

Principles for Governance and Use of Internet

 

 

The following list of principles was elaborated by Brazilian Internet Steering Committee to support and provide orientation for its actions and decisions [1]

 

 

1) Freedom privacy human rights

 

The use of Internet must be driven by the principles of freedom of expression individual privacy and the respect for human rights recognizing them as essencial to the preservation of a fair and democratic society 

 

 

 

2) Democratic and collaborative governance

 

Internet governance must be exercised in a transparent multilateral and democratic manner with the participation of the various sectors of society thereby preserving and encouraging its character as a collective creation 

 

 

 

3) Universality

 

Internet access must be universal so that it becomes a tool for human and social development thereby contributing to the formation of an inclusive and nondiscriminatory society for the befefit of all 

 

 

 

4) Diversity

 

Cultural diversity must be respected and preserved and its expression must be stimulated without the imposition of beliefs customs or values 

 

 

 

5) Innovation

 

Internet governance must promote the continuous development and widespread dissemination of new technologies and models for access and use 

 

 

 

6) Neutrality of the network

 

Filtering or traffic privileges must meet ethical and technical criteria only excluding any political commercial religious and cultural factors or any other form of discrimination or preferential treatment 

 

 

 

7) Unaccountability of the network

 

All action taken against illicit activity on the network must be aimed at those directly responsible for such activities and not as means of access and transport always upholding the fundamental principles of freedom privacy and the respect for human rights 

 

 

 

8) Functionality security and stability

 

The stability security and overall functionality of the network must be actively preserved through the adoption of technical measures that are consistent with international standards and encourage the adoption of best practices 

 

 

 

9) Standartization and interoperability

 

The Internet must be basedon open standards that facilitate interoperability and enable all to participate in its development 

 

 

 

10) Legal and regulatory environments

 

The legal and regulatory environments must preserve the dynamics of the Internet as a space for collaboration 

 

 

 

At Center of Studies of Alternative Media Barão de Itararé we believe that these are the principles that must guide a global and multi stakeholder Internet governance ecosystem These principles define guidelines to ensure that Internet remains an environment open for people and friendly for innovation 

 

 

 

 

Multi stakeholder governance model

 

 

Governments companies academy and civil society must have representatives where decisions about the Internet are taken This governance model where all the stakeholders really participate is the way to encourage discussions about the views and concerns of each participant regarding to decisions to be made 

 

 

 

Brazilian Internet Steering Committee already has this representation model in fact it was elaborated to have representatives of these four sectors in its composition and it has done a remarkable work for the development of Internet in Brazil We seek to defend at NETmundial that this multi stakeholder model is the one that should guide the governance of the Internet 

 

 

 

Threats to the future of the Internet

 

 

Global companies have lobbies trying to persuade congressmen to pass legislation against freedom of speech and against the very nature of the Internet that is sharing knowledge We have seen this happen in many countries 

 

 

Now in Brazil these lobbies are trying to change a legislation called Marco Civil da Internet so that companies could break the neutrality of the network Marco Civil da Internet is a legal framework elaborated with the contribution of thousands of people both from Internet and from public hearings Lobbyists have spoken openly with some congressmen about funding their next campaign if they now agree with their views about Internet Civil society organizations are playing a key role right now to fight these lobbies and Center of Studies of Alternative Media Barão de Itararé has joined this effort against the lobbies from the beginning 

 

 

For this reason we cannot stress enough the vital importance of civil society participation in every forum gathered to discuss the future of the Internet We aim to collaborate so that Internet remains open and free environment

The Challenge                                                                                                                                                                

Global economic growth and political stability are increasingly endangered by national barriers to the secure flow of information products and services This development is being driven by three influences 

·         Political and Economic Concerns Trade protection concerns about online content that can lead to domestic instability and anger about surveillance create political pressure for localization 

·         Security Concerns Cyber attackers increasingly menace the delivery of life-sustaining essential services international cyber criminals go unpunished and a cyber arms race threatens stability 

·         Weak Governance The national and international cyberspace governance institutions that are needed to successfully address these concerns are slow weak isolated or non-existent 

If these three influences are not successfully managed a militarized fragmented Splinternet” will emerge to threaten global economic growth and fuel dangerous regional and international instability Moreover these interrelated influences cannot be managed separately Because the network connects everywhere true security in cyberspace will require the participation across governments including many in the developing world Private sector ICT operators and suppliers national and international non-governmental organizations and the netizens themselves must also participate in shaping a common future 

Progress is urgently needed in the near term – every month that passes without action raises the costs to society of the current trends and of turning those trends around Without effective action the future safety and livelihoods of literally billions of young new Internet users will be substantially degraded increasing pressure on already fragile states 

 

The Opportunity                                                                                                                                                        

The Splinternet is an internet whose capacity and effectiveness are weakened by barriers to efficient information transfer threats to personal and public security and unresolved conflicts around norms Institutions processes and policies must be developed that will reduce the pressures driving fragmentation and minimize its negative consequences A broad initiative is needed that will convene and mobilize government and private stakeholders around three objectives that match the three influences driving fragmentation 

    Economic and Political Maturity  Promote trade in secure products and services encourage the flow of information to support education and innovation and encourage limits on cyber surveillance to enhance privacy and human rights 
    Security and Stability Work to mitigate cyber risks to critical infrastructure streamline mutual law enforcement assistance in cyber-enabled crime and promote measures of restraint in cyber weapons development and deployment 
     Sound Governance  Support the design and testing of transparent accountable orderly inclusive agile and effective management and governance structures that increase predictability and trustworthiness in cyberspace Existing multi-lateral and multi-stakeholder institutions must be strengthened and their legitimacy enhanced In some areas new institutions may be needed 

 

Relevance to NETmundial

 

The Global Multistakeholder meeting on the Future of Internet Governance takes as a dual starting point the broad base of existing principles and the small set of existing Internet governance institutions The EastWest Institute is contributing to the discussion by providing a larger context for consideration of the longer-term future of cyberspace a scope of conversation that includes but goes well beyond the current remits of ICANN the IETF the ITU and other organizations We believe that the moment is ripe to take on this larger set of issues over the next several years and arrive collectively at a set of multi-stakeholder institutions that comprise a sustainable regime for governing cyberspace in the long-term interests of humanity and of the planet

Introduction

 

The Internet offers an opportunity for inclusiveness – to view the global community of its users as one while recognising its rich diversity Internet technologies have the potential to give persons with disabilities the means to live on a more equitable basis within the global community in a manner that previously was not possible 

 
Key drivers are 
 
 

    Persons with disabilities form the world s largest minority according to the United Nations One billion people are estimated by the World Health Organisation to have a disability with 80% living in developing countries Persons with disabilities can equally participate in society and make substantial contributions to the economy if the appropriate Internet tools are available 
    Over 100 Governments have signed and ratified the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Obligations include implementing measures to design develop produce and distribute accessible ICT at an early stage so these become accessible at minimum cost for persons with disabilities 
    W3C s Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) are increasingly mandated by governments and used by industry to make websites more accessible for people with disabilities 
    More governments are starting to incorporate accessibility criteria in their public procurement policies 

 
What is accessibility 

 
For persons with disabilities accessibility means being able to use a product or service as effectively as a person without a disability This means using inclusive design principles to make products and services usable by a wider section of the population In some cases this is not possible and assistive technologies may be called upon to fill the gap If so mainstream technologies should enable the software or hardware connection of the assistive device seamlessly in terms of both interoperability and data portability 
 
 
Changing peoples  attitudes to disability is fundamental to achieving greater accessibility The traditional view of disability is through the medical model that is attempting to fix” or rehabilitate a person to society s norms The social model of disability aims to dismantle barriers so that a person with a disability can fully participate in the community This more contemporary model emphasises a person s abilities rather than disabilities and encourages a person s independence and capacity by decreasing environmental barriers 
 
 
Persons with disabilities face as many different barriers as there are types and degrees of disability For example people with a visual impairment who use screen-reading software may be confronted by websites that have confusing navigation or that lack descriptions of images; while people with a hearing impairment may be unable to participate in online conferencing because it lacks captioning 
 
 
Through removing barriers persons with disabilities will be better able to use and contribute to the richness of the Internet by participating independently in the communities of their choice While making websites accessible is vital solutions for accessibility are needed to deliver any product or service over the Internet and to accept content or services created by persons with disabilities regardless of the equipment or medium of input This includes websites databases browsers multimedia applications mobile phones computers and their auxiliary equipment 
 
 
Apart from accessibility other barriers need to be overcome so that persons with disabilities can gain benefit from the Internet and contribute value to the Internet These are 
 
 
Affordability
 
Many persons with disabilities have low incomes and limited educational opportunities This applies in developed countries and even more in developing countries Using the Internet is expensive especially in developing countries When assistive technologies are required the barrier can be even higher 
 
Cultural
 
Persons with disabilities are perceived with pity or shame in many countries They may be restrictively protected” by family for any of a number of rationales ranging from a lack of suitable educational facilities to a lack of appropriate government services 
 
Availability
 
In isolated areas there may be limited availability of the Internet Encouraging and meeting the needs of persons with disabilities may be a relatively low priority under such conditions 
 
Lack of awareness by community at large
 
People in the broader community have limited understanding of how persons with disabilities use technology and of the significant benefits the Internet can bring Making products and services accessible can therefore mistakenly be considered difficult and costly 
 
International actions
 
The United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities states that access to information and communications technologies and systems is one element that will enable persons with disabilities to participate more fully in all aspects of life The Convention stipulates that governments take appropriate measures for this to occur Over 100 countries have signed and ratified the Convention which brings responsibilities amongst other obligations to improve accessibility to the Internet for persons with disabilities The Convention also states that international cooperation and sharing of resources be done by facilitating access to and sharing of accessible and assistive technologies and through the transfer of technologies Under the Optional Protocol there are remedies available to persons with disabilities to file complaints under the UN Convention 
 
The concluding document from the United Nations World Summit on the Information Society the Tunis Agenda for the Information Society states that for equitable access to occur attention should be given to universal design and promotion of assistive technologies Universal design or Design for All is the concept of designing products and services for a wider section of the community based on seven key principles It has the benefit that products incorporating these principles may be more accessible for persons with disabilities It also means that devices do not have to be retrofitted for accessibility but take that into consideration as part of their original design 
 
The Internet Governance Forum (IGF) recognises accessibility to the Internet as a key issue and through its Dynamic Coalition on Accessibility and Disability has highlighted steps towards an inclusive society A simple form of inclusion adopted by the IGF itself is the use of real-time captions for its workshop and conference sessions including online sessions This is beneficial for persons from non-English speaking backgrounds but vital for persons with hearing impairment 
 
The standards arm of the International Telecommunication Union the ITU-T places significant emphasis on accessibility with regard to particular Study Groups Questions and Recommendations In 2008 Resolution 70 was accepted at the World Telecommunications Standardization Assembly highlighting many accessibility standardisation activities including mechanisms intended to ensure that the needs of persons with disabilities are taken into account when developing all ITU standards and guidelines 
 
Conclusion
 
Regardless of the challenges they may face persons with disabilities can contribute to society like any other member of the community when barriers are removed Increasing accessibility to the Internet can help to make that happen 
 
Explicitly incorporating inclusion to the Internet for people with disability in the Set of Internet Governance Principles is an important step in moving forwards

IIS Contribution on Internet governance principles

Abstract 

We support a multi-stakeholder bottom-up consensus-based approach to Internet governance  Internet governance processes should be open and inclusive These principles should be applied to all levels of Internet Governance local national regional and global 

Key words 

multi-stakeholder local national global open inclusive

Overall Principles

1 Internet governance should be based on multi-stakeholder bottom-up and consensus-making process  By multi-stakeholder we mean government civil society private sector and technical community are given equal footing in shaping the policy and governance mechanisms of the essential functionalities of the Internet  They need to evolve over time as the technology and society undergo changes 

Local national and regional governance mechanisms should be exercised reflecting the global principles but specific context and environments pertinent to each locale should also be kept and respected 

 

Principles for process and participation

2 Transparent accountable inclusive enabling meaningful participation 

• Transparent  it should be easy to understand how decisions are made processes should be clearly documented and follow agreed procedures  Decision-making should reflect how inputs are taken into account and should be reflected in outcomes 

Full disclosure of the institutional activities including the financial and other important records of the governing bodies must be maintained 

• Accountable mechanisms for checks and balance should exist; it should be possible for any stakeholder to be able to challenge decisions  

• Inclusive Internet governance institutions and processes should be inclusive and open to all interested stakeholders  Processes should be bottom-up enabling the full involvement of all stakeholders from agenda setting to representation in final decisions Capacity building activities should be implemented as an essential part of ensuring the inclusiveness 

• Meaningful participation Anyone affected by an Internet governance process should be able to participate in that process  Particularly Internet governance institutions and processes should strengthen outreach activities to wider members of the society support capacity building for newcomers especially stakeholders from developing countries and under represented groups  Practical measures to address the needs of non-English speakers and those who do not speak the six UN languages should also be implemented 

 

Principles for the architecture and operation of the Internet

3  We support the Internet s distributed and open architecture based on open standards and protocols developed through collaborative open processes and principles of interoperability and the ability to connect 

 

Respect and support for human rights

4  Human rights should be central values of any Internet governance principles Human rights should be equal online and offline  Internet governance should support the free flow of information as well as freedom of expression at all levels  People should be able to expect that their right to privacy enjoyed offline are also respected online 

 

Respect for diversity

5 Cultural linguistic and social diversity (e g gender age persons with disabilities) should be fully respected both in the outcomes as well as decision-making processes at the Internet Governance institutions 

 

Promote competition and choice

 

6 We recognize the need to keep the uniqueness of the critical Internet identifiers such as Domain Name and IP Addresses requires some kind of monopolistic management at the top level However healthy competition that provides the choices for end users should also be promoted as they form essential part of modern society and economy Measures safeguarding public interest and fair competition and prevent discriminatory behaviors of the monopolies must be implemented at all levels local national regional and global Independent and transparent oversight mechanisms should be placed over these monopolistic operations 

It is of great value that the importance of decoupling IP addresses management and the domain name system management from a single state actor has been recognized and that currently there is a strong push towards multistakeholderism in this area 

 

There is however a secondary emergent centralization happening on the Internet that potentially can pose a comparable or even bigger threat to the interconnected open and independent nature of this global network 

 

This centralization is harder to perceive as dangerous as it is not being actively supported by any state actor; hence it falls under the radar for many Internet activists and technologists that would react immediately had similar process been facilitated by a government It does hoever have a potential to bring negative effects similar to a state-sponsored centralization of infrastructure 

 

Another reason for this process to happen unnoticed or for the possible negative effects of it to be depreciated is that it is fluid and emergent on behaviour of many actors enforced by the network effect 

 

This process is most visibly exemplified in Facebook gathering over a 1bln of users by providing a centrally-controlled walled-garden and at the same time offering an API to developers willing to tap-into this vast resource for example to use it as authentication service Now many if not most Internet services requiring log-in as one of their options offer Facebook log-in Some (a growing number) offer Facebook as the only option Many offer commenting system devised by Facebook that does not allow anonymous comments -- a user has to have a Facebook account to be able to partake in the discussion 

 

Similarily Google is forcing Google+ on YouTube users; to a lesser extent Google Search is being used by a swath of Internet services as their default internal search engine (that is used tos earch their own website or service) GMail is also by far the most popular e-mail and XMPP service which gives Google immense power over both 

 

These are two examples of services offered by private entities (in this case Google and Facebook) that had become a de facto public infrastructure meaning that an immense number other services rely and require them to work 

 

If we recognize the danger of a single state actor controlling ICANN or IANA we can surely recognize the danger of a single actor (regardless of whether it is a state actor or not) controlling such an important part of Internet infrastructure 

 

Regardless of reasons why this situation emerged (users  lack of tech-savvy service operators  want of easiest and cheapest to implement and integrate solutions etc) it causes several problems for the free and open Internet 

 

    it hurts resillience

 

If such a large part of services and actors depend on a single service (like Facebook or GMail) this in and of itself introduces a single point of failure It is not entirely in the realm of the impossible for those companies to fail -- who will then provide the service  We have also seen both of them (as any other large tech company) have large-scale downtime events taking services based on them down also 

 

    it hurts independence

 

In the most basic sense any user of a service based on these de facto infrastructures has to comply with and agree to the underlying service (i e Facebook Google) Terms of Service If many or most of Internet services have that requirement users and service operators alike lose independence over what they accept 

 

    it hurts openness

 

Operators of such de facto infrastructures are not obliged to provide their services in an open and standard manner -- running mostly in the application layer these services usually shut-off any attempts at interoperating with them Examples include Twitter changing their API TOS to shut-off certain types of applications Google announcing the planned shut-off of XMPP server-to-server communication Facebook using XMPP for the internal chat service with server-to-server shut-off 

 

    it hurts accountability and transparency

 

With such immense and binary (either use it or lose it) control over users  and otehr service providers  data de facto infrastructure operators do not have any incentives to share information on what is happening with the data they gather They also have no incentives to be transparent and open about their future plans or protocols used in their services There is no accountability other than the binary decision to use it or lose it which is always heavily influenced by the network effect and the huge numbers of users of these services 

 

    it hurts predictability

 

With no transparency no accountability and lack of standarization such de factoinfrastructure operators can act in ways that maximizes their profits which in turn can be highly unpredictable Twitters  changing of API TOS is a good example here 

 

    it hurts interoperability

 

Such de facto infrastructure operators are strongly incentivised to shut-off any interoperability attempts The larger the number of users of their service the stronger the network effect the more other services use their service and the bigger the influence they can have on the rest of the Internet ecosystem Social networks are a good example here -- Twitter user cannot communicate with a Facebook user unless they also have an account on the other network 

 

This is obviously not the case with e-mail (I can run my own e-mail server) at least not yet The more people use a single provider here (i e GMail) the stronger GMail becomes and the easier it would be for its operator to shut-off interoperability with other providers This is exactly what Google is doing with XMPP 

 

    it hurts innovation

 

Lack of predictability opennes and independence obviously also hurts innovation What used to be a free and open area of innovation is more and more becoming a set of closed-off walled-gardens controlled by a small number of powerful actors 

 

It is also worth noting that centralized infrastructure on any level (including the level of de facto infrastructure discussed herein) creates additional problems on human rights level centralized infrastructure is easy to surveil and censor 

 

Hence the first question to be asked is this when does a private service become de facto public infrastructure 

 

At this point this question remains unanswered and there is not a single Internet Governance body or indeed any actor able to reply to it authoritatively Nevertheless we are all in dire need for an answer to this question and I deem it a challenge for Internet Governance and an important topic that should be included in any Internet Governance Forums now and in the future 

 

The second question that ever more urgently requires an answer if we are to defent the open and not balkanized Internet is what should be done about private services that have become de facto public infrastructure 

 

This question is also as of yet unanswered but there are several possible proposals that can be made including treating such situations as monopoly and breaking them up (so handling them outside Internet Governance) requiring public interoperable API available for other implementators etc This is perhaps not exactly in the purview of Internet Governance it is however crucial for the Internet as a whole and I propose it be treated as a challenge to be art least considered at IGFs henceforth

The Society for Knowledge Commons India and Brazil thanks the government of Brazil for hosting the NetMundial meeting an opportunity for governments civil society and the private sector to inter alia address the risks posed by mass surveillance to privacy diplomacy and democracy 

 

Revelations about mass surveillance have also demonstrated that current governance legal and oversight structures of the Internet have failed to keep up with technology 

 

The decision-making structures and technological architecture that worked when the Internet was born and grew in its infancy no longer work in today s world A more balanced model for sharing and governing the Internet is needed 

 

The enormous potential of the Internet is being thwarted by its increasing control by large corporations and powerful governments In addition to mass surveillance we are seeing the monopolization and commodification of information and knowledge; abusive use of personal data - in particular its unchecked monetization; erosion of cultural diversity; inequitable financial arrangements; technical decisions that lead to social injustice 

 

A The Society for Knowledge Commons reiterates and endorses the Principles provided by the Just Net Coalition and provides the following additions thereto 

 

1     The Internet should be viewed as a global commons rather than merely a market place and should never be a theatre of war  The remarkable potential of the Internet as the world s greatest library cultural archive educational institution health provider and communications exchange is threatened by efforts to reduce it to a market or militarized space It is essential that the Internet be used only for peaceful purposes and it is necessary that this be recognized by states in a binding and enforceable instrument Further every country every society must have the right to connect to the Internet and use the same in accordance with applicable law There must be no unilateral ability to disconnect a country or a region from the Internet without appropriate global sanction The Internet must be recognized as a global public utility in a similar way to how telecom networks are traditionally treated and the economic structures of the Internet regulated accordingly 

 

2     Drag net surveillance economic espionage and network sabotage are not legitimate activities and should be explicitly outlawed  These activities violate existing human rights standards diplomatic treaties and the laws of war given inter alia that sabotage will have indiscriminate affect on non-combatants Additional protocols are needed to update existing treaties to detail permissible restrictions on online activities elaborate rights and prohibit certain acts such as indiscriminate data collection back-doors into software or hardware the hacking of submarine cables and the sabotage of networks 

3     Competition law consumer law and open interoperability standards need to apply to online markets  Instead of decentralizing power as they purport the current structures of the global Internet tend to centralize control in the hands of a small number of companies and certain nation states Some of these companies have near-monopoly power over key areas of economic and social significance through producing refining adding value distributing and reselling data  Other companies own infrastructure wholesale and retail services  The need to apply fair rules to prevent e-commerce monopolies is urgent 

 

4     Unregulated non-transparent and disproportionate state controls that conduct mass surveillance of citizens violates freedom of speech and other fundamental human rights must be outlawed Existing treaties all recognize that there are legitimate surveillance activities and actors and provide a license for them to act with proper oversight and warrants based on reasonable suspicion of wrong-doing  However we now know that governments are bypassing oversight and abusing the capacity to surveil their own citizens – and those of foreign countries – just because they technically can  Specific prohibitions of modern misuses of technology must be established in law and proper checks and balances established at the national level to reflect international standards 

 

5     The information that companies can collect store and use on users must be restricted  The private sector should be allowed and required to disclose the nature of their agreements with governments and the quantities of information they are providing 

6     Digital colonialism the ability of some cultures and language dominant on the Internet to influence how culture activities and projects evolve must be recognized and addressed The potential exists for culture and news from one part of the globe to dominate all else Local industries and culture must be protected through industry specific or geographic tariff protections to stop dumping and the local distortions it causes 

 

B Towards a Roadmap for Internet Governance

 

1 The best way to preserve a global Internet is through formulating appropriate global mechanisms principles and rules that will underpin its governance There is an urgent need to democratize Internet governance structures and make them legitimate representative equitable democratic and transparent in their functioning Given its global significance the fact that the Internet is legally tied to one country no longer makes sense 

  As long as the Internet is governed under private contracts and its recognition exists only under US law there is no way that even allocation of domains and IP addresses can be done in a way that furthers the ends of equity and social justice  There are two problems with contract-based Internet governance First it has lead to privatization and corporatization that have eroded competition Second contracts do not and cannot incorporate human rights” or sovereign rights” – the rights of either individuals or of nations A bottoms-up Internet governance as distinct from developing technical standards and protocols has no legal mechanism to enforce rights of people corporations or sovereign rights of countries Given that the Internet now forms an essential part of the world s social cultural and economic infrastructure there is an urgent need to formulate a binding international framework to delineate rights and obligations inter se states as well as between states and individuals By keeping the Internet governance either under US laws or under contracts” the US has ensured that there are no international norms and is no effective global body that can address various issues such as NSA s invasive surveillance over other governments and people and penetration of vital infrastructure of other countries Neither is there any place for regulatory principles to be exercised – for example progressive taxation policies for e-commerce transactions that would help developing countries 

 

US trusteeship” of the Internet has failed as have multistakeholder” institutions such as the I-organizations  We need to internationalize essential and global public policy decision making systems to enable them to function for the benefit of global citizens and not merely the first world – which due to historical and other reasons enjoy overbearing influence on these processes There is an urgent need to ensure regional / geographic balance and representation of the under-represented and marginalized in decision-making powers 

 

A failure to make drastic changes to the status quo could quite easily lead to increased exercise of domestic sovereign authority over what should be a global commons – and therefore a very real threat of ‘balkanization  of the Internet Without a globally agreed set of framing or guiding principles to govern the Internet the Internet as we presently know it – a global tool of communication – could soon be a thing of the past as each country will attempt to propose its own governance models which it will try and enforce through domestic law This could even extend to splitting of the root zone system through the creation of local roots 

 

There is therefore an urgent need for a multilateral framework to be entered into that affirms guarantees and protects the principles referred to previously 

 

2 The multistakeholder model is current vaguely defined and applies arbitrary modalities which must be clarified through guidelines that ensure equitable representation and prevent conflicts of interest and corporate capture   The multistakeholder system purports to place all stakeholders on an equal footing but fails to recognize the different interests roles capacities and resources available to each sector  This model too often inappropriately blurs the different responsibilities and obligations of states and corporations The aforesaid is not to limit or question the role of public participation in decision-making processes - this is essential in any democratic system as is transparency 

 

3 Certain public policy functions in the context of the Internet governance that can only be dealt with through a multilateral framework While the adoption of technical standards and protocols might make sense in a multistakeholder platform it cannot be effective in preventing cyber warfare or protecting human rights dealing with regulatory issues such as cost of access and net neutrality common ownership of domain name spaces including control of CCTLDs by the country concerned and protection and stability of international telecommunication services These issues are well within the scope and competence of a nation states  traditional domain in the International legal sphere 

We believe it is essential that the following issues be given sanctity in International law (possibly and at an initial stage as general principles in a Framework Convention or through a system of protocols) 

 

(a)            Protection of human rights including privacy

(b)           Cyber warfare and cyber attacks

(c)           Regulatory issues such as cost of access net neutrality etc 

(d)           Common ownership of the domain name space including control of CCTLDs by the country concerned international control supervision and oversight of IANA functions

(e)           Protection and stability of international telecommunication services (right against disconnection etc )

 

4 In addition to the principles and issues mentioned above any Framework Convention will also need to formalize the basic architecture of the global governance of the Internet - recognizing and legitimizing the role and functions of the organisations involved in the public policy governance and technical oversight of the Internet in addition to various other bodies involved with managing the technical and logical infrastructure of the Internet (such as Regional Internet Registries Internet technical standards bodies and so on) 

 

An appropriate mechanisms for crisis response and dispute resolution in relation to the global Internet and the social activity dependent on it will also be required to be set up under this Framework Convention 

 

5 Public policy decision-making must take place within a multilateral framework with a role for public participation of all necessary stakeholders participating in accordance with their relevant roles and interests Technical oversight of essential functions of the Internet must also be founded within a global multilateral framework that recognises the Internet s essential technical parameters (such as the addressing system) as a global commons Technical standards are and must continue to be developed through a bottoms up method but must adhere to public policy principles 

Joint Contributions of Civil Society Organizations from Latin America to NetMundial

 

Abstract

 

Civil Society Organizations from across Latin America join to add their contributions to the Net Mundial meeting 

 

It is important to Civil Society Organizations from Latin-America to express ourpoint of view about the future of Internet Governance because we are a relevant component of the Internet Governance Ecosystem and the region where part of the next 2-other-billion Internet users are going to come from 

 

Considering this we have to build the road in our Region for the future enhancing cooperation in infrastructure and capacity building among others so those users can participate in the Internet Ecosystem in a more informed and qualified manner 

 

For all those reasons we think it is important that the voice of the Civil Society Organizations from Latin America shall be heard and involved in the discussion of the Set of Internet Governance Principles and the Roadmap for the future evolution of the Internet Governance Ecosystem 

 

Content Contribution 

 

Introduction

 

The members of the Civil Society Organization Network of Latin America thank the Government of Brazil in coordination with the global Internet community for the opportunity to participate and make contributions to the Global Multistakeholder Meeting on the future of Internet Governance 

 

Latin America represents 48 2% of Internet users from the Americas with an average penetration of almost 40% which is higher than the general worldwide penetration rate [1] Latin America had the fastest-growing Internet population of all regions in the world growing 12 percent between 2012 and 2013 and reaching more than 147 million unique web visitors as of last March Latin America is also an important space for economic and social innovation with the massive presence and use of social networks Latin America is an incredible environment of creativity and social mobilization with increasing expert capacity regarding the knowledge and skills that are needed to fulfill the goals of the information society 

 

However the challenges in the region are still significant when addressing the evolving Internet ecosystem thatwhichmust take into consideration the rights of a variety of stakeholders During the past few years in Latin America we have witnessed the emergence of laws and policies that violate core digital rights In several of those instances such laws and policies were developed in a non-transparent non-accountable environment without proper consultation with all affected parties Thus it is crucial to present our proposals to this consultativeprocess We hope to see the results of Net Mundial as a positive way forward for the development of the Internet and the guarantee of digital and human rights in the region 

 

Considering this we have to build the road in our Region for the future enhancing cooperation in infrastructure and capacity building among others so those users can participate in the Internet Ecosystem in a more informed and qualified manner 

 

It is important that the voice of the Civil Society Organizations from Latin America is heardand involved in the discussion of the Set of Internet Governance Principles and the Roadmap for the future evolution of the Internet Governance Ecosystem 

 

1 Set of Internet Governance Principles

 

To begin we must define Internet Governance 

 

Internet governance is the development and application by Governments the private sector and civil society in their respective roles of shared principles norms rules decision-making procedures and programmes that shape the evolution and use of the Internet (Working Definition of World Summit on the Information Society (WSIS) 

 

As members of Civil Society Organizations of Latin America exercising our role in the Internet Governance Ecosystem we defend the Internet as it was designed in the beginning as open interoperable decentralized inclusive unique democratic participative global transparent equal neutral free innovative and respectful of human rights and rule of laws 

 

We fully support several sets of Internet Governance Principles that have already been elaborated According to the nature of Internet and the development of Latin America we consider appropriate and adequate for our region to emphasize our adherence to the following principles without diminishing any others 

 

1 RESOLUTIONS ADOPTED BY THE HUMAN RIGHTS COUNCIL 20/8 THE PROMOTION PROTECTION AND ENJOYMENT OF THE HUMAN RIGHTS ON THE INTERNET[2]

 

Affirms that the same rights that people have offline must also be protected online in particular freedom of expression which is applicable regardless of frontiers and through any media of one s choice in accordance with articles 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights 

 

2 OCDE[3]

 

    Promote and protect the free flow of information 

 

    Promote the open distributed and interconnected nature of Internet 

 

    Encourage multi-stakeholder cooperation in policy development processes 

 

    Develop capacities to bring publicly available reliable data into the policy-making process 

 

    Ensure transparency fair process and accountability 

 

    Strengthen consistency and effectiveness in privacy protection at a global level 

 

    Promote Creativity and Innovation 

 

    Limit Internet intermediary liability 

 

3 PRINCIPLES FOR THE GOVERNANCE AND USE OF THE INTERNET - CGI br[4]

 

    Freedom privacy and human rights 

 

    Universality 

 

    Diversity 

 

    Neutrality of the Network 

 

    Standardization and interoperability 

 

4 APC INTERNET RIGHTS CHARTER[5]

 

    Internet Access for all 

 

    Freedom of expression and Association 

 

    Access to knowledge 

 

    Shared learning and creation - free and open software and technology development 

 

2 Roadmap for the further evolution of the Internet Governance Ecosystem

 

As Civil Society Organizations trying to fulfill our role in the Internet Governance Ecosystem and guided by the regional perspective we want to highlight the road that has to be built in our Region in order to comply with the principles cited above 

 

1 Multi-stakeholder Model

 

    To defend and reinforce the multistakeholder model the bottom-up process based in consensus and equal footing of all stakeholders in the different fora of discussion and decision making on the Internet Governance 

 

    ICANN internationalization a) Increase the real effective and active regional participation investing in outreach capacity building efficient communication b) Root servers located outside the U S territory distributed equally by region c) Transparency and accountability in compliance with ATRT2 

 

    To defend and reinforce the global IGF Review the IGF mandate allowing the elaboration of non-binding recommendations to nurture other fora where binding recommendations are decided 

 

    To strengthen the LACIGF by a) Increasing participation of all stakeholders specifically governmental participation b) Continuing discussions of the agenda and a follow-up throughout the year c) Creating a repository of the materials produced during the discussions d) Creating a Latin American Internet Governance Observatory in charge of monitoring the development of the themes discussed in the LACIGF Agenda that are treated in other fora d) Promoting the elaboration of non-binding recommendations e) Promoting and encouraging the creation of national IGF s building incentives for the exchange of experiences and best practices f) Stimulating participation of youth and young adults the future leaders of the Internet futuredecision-makers and creators in the digital environment Applying the methodology of Learning by doing and role playing 

 

    Communicating multi-stakeholder processes in a friendly clear easy transparent accessible open and multilingual manner 

 

    Ensure that no government or region shall have predominance in the Internet Governance Ecosystem 

 

2 Capacity Building and Technical Assistance

 

The major necessity in our region is capacity building on Internet Governance Issues Its natural home is the Academy When the Academy fails on building capacity it s Civil Society the Government or individual experts the ones fulfilling this need For these objectives it s essential to build a pool of regional trainers and an online learning platform to provide this services in all the languages of the region in collaboration with regional and global I* organizations 

 

Capacity building is also important for increasing government participation in all of these fora By building capacity in government representatives the public policy discussion agenda will immediately increase and improve Investing on continued capacity building is a way to assure continuous participation discussion and national representation of governments in the global discussion 

 

3 Access

 

    Infrastructure is the main issue about access in our region We still need investments (being public private or public-private partnerships) to build physical infrastructure Infrastructure is important to reduce the digital divide and allow access It is a fact that mobile penetration is higher than broadband Internet penetration in our region That should be taken into account when reducing the digital divide The governments of our region should work in collaboration with other stakeholders (civil society technical and academic community private sector) by creating permanent working-groups for the promotion of universal and non-discriminatory access to the Internet ensuring network neutrality access to broadband and to the universal Internet and shortening access divide (knowledge generational gender between the native urban and rural population) In addition many governments in our region still need to understand the importance of promoting the Internet for development and that Internet is about opportunity and permission-less innovation and no longer a luxury for its citizens The implementation of universal Internet access should be included in our government public policies agenda in collaboration with other stakeholders each of them acting on their respective roles Another essential or necessary infrastructure component is establishing IXP s in the countries of our region reaching public-private collaboration agreements This will bring positive consequences as the decreasing costs in access and increasing content production and access to them 

 

    In another access layer we can mention the access to content which is another very important issue for our region where actions should be planned To ensure that the citizens of our region countries have free and easy access to the content circulating on the Internet our governments must work in the development or improvement of laws that guarantee freedom of expression both offline and online avoiding government measures or measures from content provider private companies leading to internet content censorship as well as actions of self-censorship due to fear of reprisals; blocking Internet content and pursuit of citizens wishing to freely express their opinions ideas or beliefs on the Internet In addition our governments should work to update our copyright laws to suit our regional realities and needs This should go in hand with the development and promotion of free culture open source education of citizens about their digital rights and the promotion and development of free competitive services and products in the local and foreign market This will bring benefits in two ways it will allow the entire population to have free access to contents that are produced and distributed openly avoiding access barriers for paying expensive software licenses hardware and/or services These free culture promotion activities will increase local content will promote innovation and will promote regional content growth while also increasing cooperation in the region and the creation of new jobs 

 

4 Inclusion and Diversity

 

We emphasize the need to invest in access and infrastructure to achieve and guarantee true inclusion and diversity forchildren youth adults elders indigenous women disabled people and the respect for multilingualism multiculturalism and the preservation of oral cultures 

 

5 Respect of Human Rights

 

Given the recent acts of telecommunications mass surveillance where the human rights of worldwide citizens were violated and recalling the DO NO HARM fundamental principle we urge the governments of the region to respect international human rights adopted in international law where the countries of our region are signatories 

 

Taking into account the topology of the network it is imperative to make greater efforts to respect and defend freedom of expression and privacy; avoiding censorship or self-censorship arbitrary online content blocking without a order by a competent judicial authority decreasing Internet connection speed as a sanction mass surveillance a order by a competent judicial authority and promoting the non-infringement control of such rights by Internet service and content providers To protect these rights it s essential for Civil Society to continue to supervise the State role and at the same time for the State to superviseprivate companies Furthermore to strengthen these rights protection it is necessary that State and Civil Society take actions to restore the trust in the Internet ecosystem that users lost as a result of recent events 

 

6 Development

 

Our region still needs a lot of investment for development for this reason it is necessary to promote and encourage ICT s that result in the desired economic development creating new business models; to foster the DNS industry in our region Green ICT development and the development of technical skills to bring responsiveness and innovation in the event of natural disasters thus responding to incidents that affect the stability resilience and robustness of the network while also reinforcing the activity of CERT/CSIRT In order to promote development the region s governments should promote tax legal and educational incentives 

 

7 Participation

 

Regional participation in Internet Governance global spaces is still low To increase this participation we suggest the creation of a multistakeholder body responsible for raising funds and its administration with the aim to facilitate the involvement of national representatives from different sectors in different Internet Governance areas ensuring the participation on equal footing On the other hand we suggest to improve remote participation in these spaces taking into account the bandwidth requirements of the participating users To this end the creation of Remote Participation Centers for each of these meetings is needed These Centers should be permanently available in the languages of the region without neglecting the creation of participation Hubs at national level in charge of the different stakeholders This remote participation service must meet the accessibility requirements for an equal and inclusive participation 

 

We observe a lack of participation of communicators and journalists specialized and skilled on issues of Internet Governance which makes the message communicated not to meet the requirements of clear attractive innovative simple and friendly communication manner for beginners and newcomers 

 

Another participation deficit we observe is the low presence of young people in regional and global Internet Governance spaces To increase this participation we suggest looking for new meeting formats making them attractive innovative creative and tailored to the needs and expectations of the future Internet leaders 

 

We continue to observe that in our region there are spaces dedicated to the participation of governments such as ECLAC where Civil Society is only granted the observer status We recommend to arbitrate the necessary measures to allow participation in an equal footing to the different regional stakeholders in these similar spaces that still continue to prevent a real and effective participation especially for Civil Society Organizations 

 

8 Respect for the Rule of Law

 

Rule of law should be respected in all the activities addressed to discuss organize and implement actions on the future of Internet governance by all stakeholders involved This is in relation with the training activities mentioned above and aimed at judicial officials lawyers and judges in charge of enforcing the various national regional and international laws related to the Internet ecosystem Also the different stakeholders of our region especially our governments must assure access to digital justice and promote the implementation of online dispute resolution mechanisms 


English version of the submission

 

Our people live more globalization in the era of the information society  The emphasis of interdependence we thus introduced in the time of a desired multilateral cooperation In urban areas  young people are presented as sinking into violence  poverty and conflict A caricature of youth is often made by our politicians they see irresponsible and incapable by hiding all the intuitive and imaginative capacities of an enterprising and innovative youth if coaching is offered  Should we wait for a miracle or act for sustainable solutions in the information society   The answer to this question is part of a response to the participation of youth in all process instances that create the future of the Internet  

 

Today the overall framework of the Internet Governance is it really invested by young people  And we will try to provide  

 

* What levers programs of public and private enterprises can they use and to prepare young people to be involved in a new institutional mechanisms for participation in Internet governance at all levels  

 

* Through what youth participation can it offer guarantees that Internet governance does not give rise to new technologies drafts  

 

* Youth participation in Internet governance it can not serve as a catalyst to change the reality of unemployment and job insecurity at the time to start working life   And be a response to juvenile indignation included in this new wave that crosses the world  

In the struggle for liberation and independence  the strength of youth was used  The participation of youth in Internet governance can serve democratic outlet for these unreached account the social bad governance  victims of social exclusion the bankruptcy of the welfare state 

 

I give all of my contribution after 

Preamble

 

Privacy is a fundamental human right and is central to the maintenance of democratic societies It is essential to human dignity and it reinforces other rights such as freedom of expression and information and freedom of association and is recognised under international human rights law [1] Activities that restrict the right to privacy including communications surveillance can only be justified when they are prescribed by law they are necessary to achieve a legitimate aim and are proportionate to the aim pursued [2]

 

Before public adoption of the Internet well-established legal principles and logistical burdens inherent in monitoring communications created limits to State communications surveillance In recent decades those logistical barriers to surveillance have decreased and the application of legal principles in new technological contexts has become unclear The explosion of digital communications content and information about communications or communications metadata -- information about an individual s communications or use of electronic devices -- the falling cost of storing and mining large sets of data and the provision of personal content through third party service providers make State surveillance possible at an unprecedented scale [3] Meanwhile conceptualisations of existing human rights law have not kept up with the modern and changing communications surveillance capabilities of the State the ability of the State to combine and organize information gained from different surveillance techniques or the increased sensitivity of the information available to be accessed 

 

The frequency with which States are seeking access to both communications content and communications metadata is rising dramatically without adequate scrutiny [4] When accessed and analysed communications metadata may create a profile of an individual s life including medical conditions political and religious viewpoints associations interactions and interests disclosing as much detail as or even greater detail than would be discernible from the content of communications [5] Despite the vast potential for intrusion into an individual s life and the chilling effect on political and other associations legislative and policy instruments often afford communications metadata a lower level of protection and do not place sufficient restrictions on how they can be subsequently used by agencies including how they are data-mined shared and retained 

 

In order for States to actually meet their international human rights obligations in relation to communications surveillance they must comply with the principles set out below These principles apply to surveillance conducted within a State or extraterritorially The principles also apply regardless of the purpose for the surveillance -- law enforcement national security or any other regulatory purpose They also apply both to the State s obligation to respect and fulfil individuals  rights and also to the obligation to protect individuals  rights from abuse by non-State actors including corporate entities [6] The private sector bears equal responsibility for respecting human rights particularly given the key role it plays in designing developing and disseminating technologies; enabling and providing communications; and - where required - cooperating with State surveillance activities Nevertheless the scope of the present Principles is limited to the obligations of the State 

 

Changing technology and definitions

 

"Communications surveillance in the modern environment encompasses the monitoring interception collection analysis use preservation and retention of interference with or access to information that includes reflects arises from or is about a person s communications in the past present or future Communications include activities interactions and transactions transmitted through electronic mediums such as content of communications the identity of the parties to the communications location-tracking information including IP addresses the time and duration of communications and identifiers of communication equipment used in communications 

 

Traditionally the invasiveness of communications surveillance has been evaluated on the basis of artificial and formalistic categories Existing legal frameworks distinguish between content or non-content  subscriber information or metadata  stored data or in transit data data held in the home or in the possession of a third party service provider [7] However these distinctions are no longer appropriate for measuring the degree of the intrusion that communications surveillance makes into individuals  private lives and associations While it has long been agreed that communications content deserves significant protection in law because of its capability to reveal sensitive information it is now clear that other information arising from communications – metadata and other forms of non-content data – may reveal even more about an individual than the content itself and thus deserves equivalent protection Today each of these types of information might taken alone or analysed collectively reveal a person s identity behaviour associations physical or medical conditions race color sexual orientation national origins or viewpoints; or enable the mapping of the person s location movements or interactions over time [8] or of all people in a given location including around a public demonstration or other political event As a result all information that includes reflects arises from or is about a person s communications and that is not readily available and easily accessible to the general public should be considered to be protected information and should accordingly be given the highest protection in law 

 

In evaluating the invasiveness of State communications surveillance it is necessary to consider both the potential of the surveillance to reveal protected information as well as the purpose for which the information is sought by the State Communications surveillance that will likely lead to the revelation of protected information that may place a person at risk of investigation discrimination or violation of human rights will constitute a serious infringement on an individual s right to privacy and will also undermine the enjoyment of other fundamental rights including the right to free expression association and political participation This is because these rights require people to be able to communicate free from the chilling effect of government surveillance A determination of both the character and potential uses of the information sought will thus be necessary in each specific case 

 

When adopting a new communications surveillance technique or expanding the scope of an existing technique the State should ascertain whether the information likely to be procured falls within the ambit of protected information before seeking it and should submit to the scrutiny of the judiciary or other democratic oversight mechanism In considering whether information obtained through communications surveillance rises to the level of protected information the form as well as the scope and duration of the surveillance are relevant factors Because pervasive or systematic monitoring has the capacity to reveal private information far in excess of its constituent parts it can elevate surveillance of non-protected information to a level of invasiveness that demands strong protection [9]

 

The determination of whether the State may conduct communications surveillance that interferes with protected information must be consistent with the following principles 

 

The Principles

 

Legality Any limitation to the right to privacy must be prescribed by law The State must not adopt or implement a measure that interferes with the right to privacy in the absence of an existing publicly available legislative act which meets a standard of clarity and precision that is sufficient to ensure that individuals have advance notice of and can foresee its application Given the rate of technological changes laws that limit the right to privacy should be subject to periodic review by means of a participatory legislative or regulatory process 

 

Legitimate Aim Laws should only permit communications surveillance by specified State authorities to achieve a legitimate aim that corresponds to a predominantly important legal interest that is necessary in a democratic society Any measure must not be applied in a manner which discriminates on the basis of race colour sex language religion political or other opinion national or social origin property birth or other status 

 

Necessity Laws permitting communications surveillance by the State must limit surveillance to that which is strictly and demonstrably necessary to achieve a legitimate aim Communications surveillance must only be conducted when it is the only means of achieving a legitimate aim or when there are multiple means it is the means least likely to infringe upon human rights The onus of establishing this justification in judicial as well as in legislative processes is on the State 

 

Adequacy Any instance of communications surveillance authorised by law must be appropriate to fulfil the specific legitimate aim identified 

 

Proportionality Communications surveillance should be regarded as a highly intrusive act that interferes with the rights to privacy and freedom of opinion and expression threatening the foundations of a democratic society Decisions about communications surveillance must be made by weighing the benefit sought to be achieved against the harm that would be caused to the individual s rights and to other competing interests and should involve a consideration of the sensitivity of the information and the severity of the infringement on the right to privacy 

 

Specifically this requires that if a State seeks access to or use of protected information obtained through communications surveillance in the context of a criminal investigation it must establish to the competent independent and impartial judicial authority that 

 

    there is a high degree of probability that a serious crime has been or will be committed;

    evidence of such a crime would be obtained by accessing the protected information sought;

    other available less invasive investigative techniques have been exhausted;

    information accessed will be confined to that reasonably relevant to the crime alleged and any excess information collected will be promptly destroyed or returned; and

    information is accessed only by the specified authority and used for the purpose for which authorisation was given 

 

If the State seeks access to protected information through communication surveillance for a purpose that will not place a person at risk of criminal prosecution investigation discrimination or infringement of human rights the State must establish to an independent impartial and competent authority 

 

    other available less invasive investigative techniques have been considered;

    information accessed will be confined to what is reasonably relevant and any excess information collected will be promptly destroyed or returned to the impacted individual; and

    information is accessed only by the specified authority and used for the purpose for which was authorisation was given 

 

Competent Judicial Authority Determinations related to communications surveillance must be made by a competent judicial authority that is impartial and independent The authority must be 

 

    separate from the authorities conducting communications surveillance;

    conversant in issues related to and competent to make judicial decisions about the legality of communications surveillance the technologies used and human rights; and

    have adequate resources in exercising the functions assigned to them 

 

Due process Due process requires that States respect and guarantee individuals  human rights by ensuring that lawful procedures that govern any interference with human rights are properly enumerated in law consistently practiced and available to the general public Specifically in the determination on his or her human rights everyone is entitled to a fair and public hearing within a reasonable time by an independent competent and impartial tribunal established by law [10] except in cases of emergency when there is imminent risk of danger to human life In such instances retroactive authorisation must be sought within a reasonably practicable time period Mere risk of flight or destruction of evidence shall never be considered as sufficient to justify retroactive authorisation 

 

User notification Individuals should be notified of a decision authorising communications surveillance with enough time and information to enable them to appeal the decision and should have access to the materials presented in support of the application for authorisation Delay in notification is only justified in the following circumstances 

 

    Notification would seriously jeopardize the purpose for which the surveillance is authorised or there is an imminent risk of danger to human life; or

    Authorisation to delay notification is granted by the competent judicial authority at the time that authorisation for surveillance is granted; and

    The individual affected is notified as soon as the risk is lifted or within a reasonably practicable time period whichever is sooner and in any event by the time the communications surveillance has been completed The obligation to give notice rests with the State but in the event the State fails to give notice communications service providers shall be free to notify individuals of the communications surveillance voluntarily or upon request 

 

Transparency States should be transparent about the use and scope of communications surveillance techniques and powers They should publish at a minimum aggregate information on the number of requests approved and rejected a disaggregation of the requests by service provider and by investigation type and purpose States should provide individuals with sufficient information to enable them to fully comprehend the scope nature and application of the laws permitting communications surveillance States should enable service providers to publish the procedures they apply when dealing with State communications surveillance adhere to those procedures and publish records of State communications surveillance 

 

Public oversight States should establish independent oversight mechanisms to ensure transparency and accountability of communications surveillance [11] Oversight mechanisms should have the authority to access all potentially relevant information about State actions including where appropriate access to secret or classified information; to assess whether the State is making legitimate use of its lawful capabilities; to evaluate whether the State has been transparently and accurately publishing information about the use and scope of communications surveillance techniques and powers; and to publish periodic reports and other information relevant to communications surveillance Independent oversight mechanisms should be established in addition to any oversight already provided through another branch of government 

 

Integrity of communications and systems In order to ensure the integrity security and privacy of communications systems and in recognition of the fact that compromising security for State purposes almost always compromises security more generally States should not compel service providers or hardware or software vendors to build surveillance or monitoring capability into their systems or to collect or retain particular information purely for State surveillance purposes A priori data retention or collection should never be required of service providers Individuals have the right to express themselves anonymously; States should therefore refrain from compelling the identification of users as a precondition for service provision [12]

 

Safeguards for international cooperation In response to changes in the flows of information and in communications technologies and services States may need to seek assistance from a foreign service provider Accordingly the mutual legal assistance treaties (MLATs) and other agreements entered into by States should ensure that where the laws of more than one state could apply to communications surveillance the available standard with the higher level of protection for individuals is applied Where States seek assistance for law enforcement purposes the principle of dual criminality should be applied States may not use mutual legal assistance processes and foreign requests for protected information to circumvent domestic legal restrictions on communications surveillance Mutual legal assistance processes and other agreements should be clearly documented publicly available and subject to guarantees of procedural fairness 

 

Safeguards against illegitimate access States should enact legislation criminalising illegal communications surveillance by public or private actors The law should provide sufficient and significant civil and criminal penalties protections for whistle blowers and avenues for redress by affected individuals Laws should stipulate that any information obtained in a manner that is inconsistent with these principles is inadmissible as evidence in any proceeding as is any evidence derivative of such information States should also enact laws providing that after material obtained through communications surveillance has been used for the purpose for which information was given the material must be destroyed or returned to the individual

Multistakeholderism

 

We would want to see articulation of a multistakholder framework that allows not only for participation and contribution into Internet policy and governance by all stakeholders   but also a reflection of the contributions in the final outcomes 

 

 

The process of internet public policy will need to be inclusive and transparent so that each stakeholder holds the same importance 

The final outcomes should be agreed on through enhanced cooperation by all regions 

 

 

Multinationals

Internet grip by undemocratic giant private multinationals continually acquiring or killing emerging competition and innovations should also be told off We have recent evidence of such corporations going into bed with governments to achieve their mutual interests 

Substantive Principles Any Model of Internet Governance Should Promote the Following Principles 

       The world deserves the access to knowledge   services   commerce   and communication   the accompanying benefits to economic development   education   and health care   and the informed discussion that the Internet provides  Governance should promote expanding access to broadband networks so that these benefits can reach all of the world s citizens   

       The Internet s importance as a platform for commerce   for education   for information and knowledge sharing   for self-expression   and for organization and assembly   depends on the global free flow of information  Any model for governance must promote this free flow of information 

       Governance should promote the ability to innovate   to develop technical capacity   and to create and take advantage of economic opportunities  To achieve this end   any model of Internet governance must promote the open   distributed   interoperable   and interconnected nature of the Internet 

       Because the Internet is an integral part of the global economy   its security   stability   and resiliency must be preserved 

       Individuals should be able to exercise their human rights   both online and offline 

       Governments should recognize limitations on their ability to collect information on Internet users based on users  reasonable privacy interests and the impact on trust in the Internet 

 

Governance Principles Any Model of Internet Governance Should Have the Following Characteristics 

       All stakeholders -- individual users   governments   civil society   businesses   and members of the academic and technical community -- have a stake in preserving the Internet as a critical platform for communication and information exchange   and therefore all stakeholders should be included in governance decisions  All of these stakeholders have contributed to the development of the Internet to date   and working together   they have driven unprecedented growth in access to   uses of   and innovation on the Internet  They must continue to be involved in any future model of Internet governance 

       Any policy-making associated with the Internet must promote openness   transparency   and accountability   and must be grounded in respect for the rule of law 

ISOC Tunisia thanks the Brazilian government   CGI br   and the Executive Multistakeholder Committee for the opportunity to participate in the Global Multistakeholder Meeting on the Future of Internet Governance 

 

The Internet and the World Wide Web have generated an unprecedented explosion in commerce and creativity According to a May 2011 study by the McKinsey Global Institute (“Internet Matters The net s sweeping impact on growth   jobs   and prosperity”)   nearly eight trillion dollars of online commerce occurs each year through e-commerce The same report states that the Internet accounts for 21 percent of gross domestic product growth in the last five years in mature countries   and that the benefits are not reserved for Internet companies – in fact   75 percent of Internet economic impact benefits companies that are not pure Internet players A March 2012 report by the Boston Consulting Group – entitled The Internet Economy in the G-20  The $4 2 Trillion Growth Opportunity” – provides policy makers more data about the impact of the Internet on economic growth and job creation According to the report   Internet-savvy small- and medium-sized enterprises (SME) across eleven of the G-20 countries have experienced 22 percent higher revenue growth over the last three years than comparable businesses with no Internet usage The report also found that SMEs that have an Internet presence generate more jobs In Germany   for example   93 percent of companies that were heavy users of the Internet and web services increased employment over the past three years   compared with only 50 percent of their offline competitors 

 

Despite the significant positive impact of the Internet on the world s economy   this transformative technology stands at a crossroads Some governments want to replace the existing multi-stakeholder model of Internet governance   through which governments   civil society   industry   the engineering community   and users all recognize a shared responsibility and role in the continued advancement of the Internet These governments instead are advancing a regulatory approach that strengthens their role at the expense of other stakeholders -- effectively excluding those who have conceptualized   built   operated   and contributed to the Internet s success 

 

The entire Internet community -- including governments   businesses   civil society   academic and technical experts   and individual users -- must continue working together if we want the Internet to remain an open   vibrant platform for innovation   growth   and the free exchange of ideas   and if we want to expand the reach of this technology to those who remain unconnected

Knowledge Commons appreciates the opportunity to present a submission on the technical architecture that will be required for a more democratic Internet to the Global Multi-stakeholder Meeting on the Future of Internet Governance While policy and legal frameworks are the principle focus of the NetMundial meeting   many of the solutions for the future of Internet governance are technical   and without a technical grounding many of the policy and legal frameworks might be meaningless 

As an organization that includes technology specialists   we offer the following observations and recommendations on the understanding that good engineering and technical solutions will require political and social support 

The technological architecture that worked when the Internet was born and grew in its infancy is in many ways outdated The impetus for the NetMundial arose because trust and confidence in the Internet was fundamentally undermined by mass surveillance and economic espionage   both possible because of the Internet s technical architecture 

Leaving current practices   protocols and infrastructure unchanged poses risks to the privacy of citizens   the capacity of governments to engage with one another in trust   and the ability of the financial system to function Therefore there is a need to alter the technical architecture of the Internet 

 

1 The future growth of the Internet needs to emphasize decentralized architecture and more evenly distributed infrastructure

Decentralization and distribution of network architecture is needed to improve the storage and privacy of data 

The Internet s infrastructure of copper   fiber optic cable and satellite communications is global and often described as a decentralized network of networks However   the bulk of global voice and Internet traffic passes through the territory or company servers of one country and is subject to its laws 

This centralization of ownership and control of physical cables   routers   servers and data is at the core of the problem s made clear by the revelations of Edward Snowden; if all the data is going through a single location it is vulnerable to the back doors in software and hardware utilized by agencies of that country Scholars have described this as ‘governance by architecture  or ‘governance by design  

The global north currently owns the cloud and most of the fiber optic cable  Countries in the global south should be encouraged to aggressively lay their own cables and generate domestic cloud capacities   to protect privacy and encourage local innovation and competition via architecture 

The question of being connected is urgent for 5 billion people currently not enjoying access to the Internet However   connecting them with the most polluted tools   storing data and applications in locations unknown and routing data through jurisdictions that do not guarantee their rights will simply magnify the privacy and security problems currently experienced by the 2 billion people online 

Naming systems are essential for the Internet to work   but the current naming system is hierarchical and gives control to entities in control of this hierarchy Control over the naming system has led some parties to illegally take over domain names without due process 

 

2 Free and Open Source Software and Hardware without backdoors

When we do not know what our machines are doing and what is on our motherboards   we cannot have communication and services that uphold our universal human rights to privacy   freedom of expression and association To ensure that   software and hardware should be fully auditable and interoperable Only Free and Open Software and Hardware implementing Open Standards can give us the chance to stop the backdoors   allowing complete auditability and interoperability 

An open and decentralized Internet requires strict enforcement of open and public standards   which allow fully interoperable implementation by anyone in any type of software and hardware The trend towards privatization of digital standards must be stemmed and measures must be introduced to ensure that standards are publicly owned   freely accessible and implementable 

The applications and protocols necessary for a connected life must be free and open source These include operating systems   mobile phones basebands    distributed data storage   email clients   instant messaging and video/voice communication User friendly and affordable technical solutions need to be made available to individuals and governments A strong responsibility lies with technologists and their industries to provide more user friendly   easy to run solutions and options for secure communications 

The long-term solutions   particularly hardware production   requires enormous human and economic resources   but every citizen will benefit from free software and open hardware that is verifiably safe and based on architectures that does not give power to a central or single entity 

 

3 Private social platforms put users at risk   and compromise local interests

Commercial social media platforms displaced the open distributed systems that made up the original applications used on the Internet   rather than   platforms based on open protocols like email   Usenet   IRC etc People communicate on sites like Facebook and Twitter and rather than hosting media on their own web servers   with domains under their control   they use sites like YouTube and SoundCloud The commercial nature of these companies means that collecting data on their users is required for them to make profits These are global north based companies with a market position that allows them to dominate global markets   thereby squeezing out local alternatives and collecting massive amounts of data on citizens of other countries without regulatory oversight 

Public funding was necessary to build out key infrastructure like the telephone system and the railways   and public funds continue to support local culture in many countries by way of supporting public broadcasting on TV and radio   and provides funding for local film and arts In order for a free Internet to be developed for the best interests of local citizens and local business   public funds will need to support development of tools that will give users alternatives to the social media monopolies These applications and tools must be open and distributed on nature   and designed to protect the users privacy 

 

4 Strong encryption must be mandatory in all core protocols

There are a large number of core protocols that currently have strong cryptography added as an afterthought   if at all   and frequently have optional insecure fallback modes   which can be in various cases coerced by an attacker Many protocols containing sensitive information are communicated in the clear   and many protocols requiring validation of authenticity are sent without any such authentication   making fake identity attacks trivial 

To guarantee that citizens have their privacy protected   all cryptographic libraries used in the core protocols should be open and frequently verified   so that their implementations will be safe for global usage 

 

5 There is a difference between what is technically possible and what is legal or acceptable – new agreements will require trust and technical verification 

This difference is recognized in International Humanitarian Law – the laws of war – where indiscriminate weapons and torture are outlawed New treaty agreements – or additional protocols to existing treaties – are needed to apply similar limits to online activities   to elaborate rights and prohibit certain acts 

Existing treaties   human rights and trade instruments oblige governments to secure data   protect citizen s human rights to privacy and freedom of expression   and to not spy on each other s citizens  These treaties all recognize that there are legitimate surveillance activities and actors   and provide a license for them to act with proper oversight and warrants based on reasonable suspicion of wrong-doing  However   we now know that governments and corporations are bypassing oversight and abusing the capacity to surveil their own citizens – and those of foreign countries – just because they technically can 

The technology can be configured differently  

Technical experts will be needed to ensure that any new principles agreed upon by governments actually prohibit and police indiscriminate data collection   backdoors into software or hardware   the hacking of submarine cables   the sabotage of networks etc And new standard operating procedures with regular reporting on arrangements between governments and corporations that protect private data will need to be implemented 

APC s Proposed Internet Governance Principles   8 March 2014

APC believes that the ability to share information and communicate freely using the internet is vital to the realisation of human rights as enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (1948)   the International Covenant on Economic   Social and Cultural Rights (1976)   the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (1976) and the Convention of the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW   1980) The internet can only be a tool to empower the peoples of the world if its governance   development and management is based on the following principles (which are derived from the APC Internet Rights Charter from 2001 – http //www apc org/en/node/5677 The APC Charter is cited by other submissions to NetMundial   for example in http //bestbits net/netmundial-principles/ It is also in the list of NetMundial source documents )Based on the APC Charter we propose six key principles 1 Access for all 2 Freedom of expression and association  3 Access to knowledge and shared learning and creation4 Privacy   freedom from surveillance and the right to use encryption 5 Democratic   transparent and participative internet governance6 Awareness   protection and realisation of human rights on the internet   and through the internet
1 Internet access for all

Internet access is an enabler of civil and political rights   and of economic   social and cultural rights Internet governance   development and management should at all times ensure affordable access for all Access for all can help create more egalitarian societies   strengthen educational and health services   local business   public participation in political processes   access to information   good governance and poverty eradication 

    Access to infrastructure irrespective of where you live The internet serves as a global public infrastructure This infrastructure must be widely distributed and support sufficient bandwidth to enable people everywhere to utilise its potential for raising their voices   improving their lives and expressing their creativity People have the right to well-distributed national internet backbones that are connected to international networks   be they located on a small-island state   or in a large metropolis 
    Inclusive design Interfaces   content and applications must be accessible to people with physical   sensory or cognitive disabilities The principle of inclusive design and the use of assistive technologies must be applied consistently 

    Equal access for men and women In many places women and men do not have equal access to learn about   define   access   use and shape the internet Efforts to increase access must recognise and redress existing gender inequalities 
    Affordability Policy-makers and regulators must ensure that all citizens have affordable access to the internet The development of telecommunications infrastructure   and the setting of rules   pricing   taxes and tariffs   should make broadband access possible for all income groups 
    Public access Many people will never enjoy affordable broadband access in their homes   and access through mobile phones has limitations Public access at telecentres   libraries   community centres   clinics and schools must be made available so that all people can have full access to the internet within easy walking distance of where they live or work 

    Access in the workplace Employers must enable internet access in the workplace 
    Cultural and linguistic diversity Technical development and public policy must encourage linguistic diversity on the internet and simplify the exchange of information across language barriers 

2 Freedom of expression and association

Article 18   UDHR Everyone has the right to freedom of thought   conscience and religionArticle 19   UDHR Everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression; this right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek   receive and impart information and ideas through any media regardless of frontiersArticle 20   UDHR Everyone has the right to freedom of peaceful assembly and association

    Freedom of expression should be protected from infringement by government and non-state actors The internet is a medium for both public and private exchange of views and information across a variety of frontiers Individuals must be able to express opinions and ideas   and share information freely and privately when using the internet 
    Freedom from censorship The internet must be protected from all attempts to silence critical voices and to censor social and political content or debate 
    Freedom of association Organisations   communities and individuals should be free to use the internet to organise and engage in online protest and organise offline protest 

3 Access to knowledge and shared learning and creation

Article 27   UDHR Everyone has the right to participate in the cultural life of the community   to enjoy the arts and to share in scientific advancement and its benefits

    Knowledge commons Wide-spread access to knowledge and a healthy knowledge commons form the basis for sustainable human development The internet enables knowledge-sharing and collaborative knowledge-creation 
    Freedom of information Governments must implement freedom of information legislation   and ensure that all information   including scientific and social research   that is produced with the support of public funds be freely available to all through internet 
    The right to share The internet offers extraordinary opportunity for sharing information and knowledge   and for new forms of creating content   tools and applications Providers of tools   internet services and content   should not prohibit people from utilising the internet for shared learning and content creation Protection of the interests of creators must occur in a way consistent with open and free participation in scientific and cultural knowledge flows 
    Free and open source software (FOSS) APC supports the use of FOSS on the internet Working with FOSS is empowering   it builds skills   is more sustainable and it encourages local innovation Access to the source code makes the internet more secure because applications are subject to public scrutiny We encourage governments to make policies that encourage the use of FOSS   particularly in the public sector 
    Open technological standards Technical standards used on the internet must always be open to allow interoperability and innovation 

4 Privacy   freedom from undue surveillance and the right to use encryption

Article 12   UDHR No one shall be subjected to arbitrary interference with his privacy   family   home or correspondence   nor to attacks upon his honour and reputation

    Data protection Public or private organisations that require personal information from individuals must collect only the minimal data necessary and for the minimal period of time needed They must only process data for the minimal stated purposes Collection   use   disclosure and retention of this information must comply with a transparent privacy policy which allows people to find out what is collected Data collected must be protected from unauthorised disclosure and security errors should be rectified without delay Data must be deleted when no longer necessary for the purposes for which it was collected The public must be warned about the potential for misuse of data supplied Organisations have a responsibility to notify people when the information has been abused   lost   or stolen 
    Encryption People communicating on the internet must have the right to use tools which encode messages to ensure secure   private and anonymous communication 
    Freedom from undue surveillance People should be able to communicate free of the threat of surveillance and interception Where surveillance does happen it needs to adhere to clear and transparent principles and comply with rule of law 

Surveillance by States Surveillance by States should comply with the following principles (derived from Necessary and Proportionate” https //en necessaryandproportionate org/    and Minister Carl Bildt s input at the October 2013 Seoul Conference on Cyberspace   http //www regeringen se/content/1/c6/22/65/90/696126a5 pdf

i Legality Be be based on laws that were adopted in a transparent manner through a democratic process ii Legitimate aim Surveillance must be conducted on the basis of a legitimate and well-defined aim and surveillance measures may never be carried out in a discriminatory or discretionary manner and only by specified state authorities iii Necessity and adequacy The law should specify under what circumstances surveillance is necessary and justify its application   and then only to the extent adequate to achieve the legitimate aim iv Proportionality A sound judgment must be made by a judicial authority   ideally an independent court   to carefully assess whether the benefits of surveillance outweigh its negative consequences v Judicial authority Decisions on the use of communications surveillance should be taken by a competent authority As a general rule   an independent court should take such decisions vi Transparency States should be as transparent as possible about how they carry out surveillance and under which circumstances court orders may be requested to practice surveillance They should provide information on how the surveillance legislation works in practice vii Public oversight Parliamentary or other credible institutions must provide oversight over relevant legislation and the practice of surveillance 
5 Governance of the internet

    Multilateral and multistakeholder democratic governance of the internet Internet governance should be multilateral [note added in 2014 multilateral here means multiple countries and parties   not among governments] and democratic   with the full involvement of governments   the private sector   civil society and international organisations No single government   or sub-groups of governments   should have a pre-eminent role in relation to international internet governance 
    Transparent and accessible All decision-making processes related to the governance and development of the internet should be open and accessible at global   regional and national levels 
    Decentralised and collaborative The technological development and core resource management of the internet must be decentralised and collaborative   and help to ensure that the network is interoperable   functional   stable   secure   efficient and scalable in the long run 
    Open architecture The internet as a ‘network of networks  is made up of many interconnected networks   based on the key underlying technical idea of open architecture networking   in which any type of network anywhere can be included and made publicly available Open architecture must be protected 
    Open standards Most of the protocols at the core of the internet are protocols based on open standards that are efficient   trusted   and open to global scrutiny and implementation with little or no licencing restrictions The protocol specifications must remain available to anyone   at no cost   considerably reducing barriers to entry and enabling interoperability 
    Network neutrality The  intelligence  of the internet resides in the computers   application-servers   mobile and other devices at the edges of the network   able to freely communicate directly with any other device on the network This end-to-end model is the source of the massive innovation that caused the explosive development of the internet as the platform for broader economic and societal development But if the more wealthy can pay to have their traffic on the Internet prioritised   the next  Facebook  or  Google  idea will never see the light of day The principle of net neutrality must therefore be applied to prevent attempts to create a tiered internet controlled by specific multinational corporate interests 
    The internet as an integrated whole The interoperability of the internet is an intrinsic part of the internet s value as a global public good and should not be fragmented by threats to create national intranets   the use of content filtering   unwarranted surveillance   invasion of privacy and curbs on freedom of expression 
    The internet should be a demilitarized zone which cannot legally be used as a platform to mount technical/infrastructural attacks on other parties (i e DDOS   viruses etc ) 

6 Awareness   protection and realisation of rights

    Human rights protection   promotion   awareness and education   The rights of people as users of the internet must be protected by international human rights declarations   law and policy practice   National   regional and global governing bodies must make information about rights and procedures related to the internet freely available   This involves public education to inform people of their rights when using the internet and mechanisms to address rights violations 
    Recourse when human rights are violated   People need free public access to effective and accountable mechanisms for addressing violations of rights   When human and internet rights are threatened by internet-based content   or by illegitimate surveillance   limitations on freedoms of expressions   and other rights   parties should have access to recourse mechanisms for taking action against such infringements 

Practical tools are also needed to support good Internet governance practice   APC has worked on such a tool and developed   in partnership with the Council of Europe and UNECE   the Code of good practice on information   participation and transparency in internet governance   The Code continues to be living document and as such is a work in progress   More information about it is available http //www intgovcode org/index php/Main_Page

As the result of an analysis of the existing charters or statements on Internet governance principles   the undersigned Brazilian civil society organizations   committed to the development of the Internet and its use for advancing social and economic justice   have identified both APC Internet Rights Charter (2006) and Internet Rights and Principles Coalition Charter (Charter of Human Rights and Principles for the Internet - 2011) as the more comprehensible and important compilation of principles to address the need to reinforce the protection of fundamental human rights in the internet 
 
Both letters re-endorse the government commitments from reached during the WSIS process   and clearly expressed in the Tunis Agenda and in the Geneva Declaration of Principles and Plan of Action   both considered fundamental to address the need to build an inclusive development-oriented Information Society  They also can be endorsed as a clear exercise on how to relate the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) to the Internet and its governance   Therefore should serve as the basis to address the challenge proposed by NETmundial to identify a set of universal Internet Governance Principles to be promoted as a global inspiration for the evolution of the Internet worldwide" 
 
Nevertheless   it is important to highlight that all this rights can only be implemented and enforced if the institutional environment for Internet Governance enables not only a transparent   accessible and accountable decision making process - including those pertaining technical standards - but also allows effective participation of representatives from all the different stakeholder groups   in it s wide diversity   concerning region   culture   gender   etc   Further developments on this institutional framework for the evolution of Internet Governance Ecosystem will also be presented by this group in that particular section for content submission at this same platform from NetMundial 
 
To move forward in the debate of principles   we have been doing an exercise to merge both Charters of principles and also update them   concerning current challenges for the perspective of the Internet as a global platform for social   economic and human development and a catalyzer to exercise human rights "
 
The result of this merging exercise is just as follows 
 
Set of Universal Internet Governance Principles to be promoted as a global inspiration for the evolution of the internet worldwide
 
1   Right to digital inclusion and access to internet
Access is an enabler of fundamental human rights   and it should be seen beyond the right to have connectivity   it should include the idea of digital inclusion   which means have the right to develop skills to shape the internet to meet people s need   which should be achieved by securing the         
right to universal access   including the right to access to infrastructure irrespective of where you live;
right to quality of service standard minimum speed   signal or connection stability   same bandwidth for uploads and downloads   net neutrality   reliably customer services;

right to integrated and inclusive public policies on education   culture and training on technology   which should not mean training just for a specific software or application;
 
2   Right to net neutrality and openness
The principle of net neutrality implies that all Internet traffic is treated in an isonomic way   ie   without discrimination based on content   device   author   source or destination of the content   service or application   Connection providers or governments should not be allowed to use its control over the Internet infrastructure or its market power to block   prioritize   slowing access to certain content   applications or services   such as the transmission to peer-to-peer   That means we should ensure 
right to end-to-end principle no inspection on content packs should be allowed;
right to open architecture the internet as a ‘network of networks  is made up of many interconnected networks   based on the key underlying technical idea of open architecture networking   in which any type of network anywhere can be included and made publicly available;
right to open standards;     
right to decentralized   collaborative and interoperable internet 
 
3   Access to Knowledge and Right to Culture
The internet has enabled the access to cultural good and knowledge in a way never seen before   a characteristic that can serve as basis for sustainable human development   As such   we should protect the 
Right to education through and about the Internet;
Right to knowledge commons and public domain publicly funded research and intellectual and cultural work must be available freely to the general public;
Right to share information and knowledge in a way consistent with an open and free participation in scientific and cultural life of the community;
Right to free and open source software (FOSS) choice;    
Right to open technological standards;    
Right to benefit from the convergence of media technologies 
 
4   Freedom of expression and association

Right to National Legislations on Data Protection;
Right to no mandatory data retention;
Right to safe and secure storage of data;
Right to privacy of metadata;
Right to transparent and comprehensive privacy policies and settings of all services;
Right to Freedom from Surveillance and from bulk collection of Internet communication records;     
Right to use Encryption;
Right to anonymity;
Right to standards of confidentiality and integrity of IT-Systems (no backdoors) 
 
6   Diversity and Non-Discrimination

Right to access and create content that is culturally and linguistically diverse;
Right to equal access for men and women;
Right to accessibility interfaces   content and applications     accessible to all   including people with physical   sensory or cognitive disabilities   people who are not literate an people who speak minority languages;
Right to equal access for marginalized groups   including elderly   young people       ethnic minorities;
Right to equal access to public electronic services

Report of the Working Group on Improvements
to the Internet Governance Forum
Executive summary
This report has been prepared by the Chair on behalf of the Working Group on
Improvements to the Internet Governance Forum in response to the requests by the
Economic and Social Council in its resolution 2010/2 and by the General Assembly in its
resolution A/RES/65/141   Taking into account the results of the first two meetings held by
the Working Group in early 2011   it gives a brief account of the establishment and the
outcome of its three meetings held at the end of 2011 and in early 2012   within the
framework of resolution 2011/16 extending the mandate of the Working Group   which had
not been able to complete its task given the complexity and political sensitivity of the
subject   During these three last meetings   the Group continued to fulfil its task   on the basis
of the work already accomplished and in line with the mandate set out in the Tunis Agenda 
The Working Group established areas which should be improved   as well as broad
agreements in this regard to guide and structure the drafting of specific and relevant
recommendations on improvements to the Internet Governance Forum   As requested   they
are included in this report 

Introduction
1   On 19 July 2010   the Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) adopted   by
consensus   resolution 2010/2 on the Assessment of the progress made in the
implementation of and follow-up to the outcomes of the World Summit on the Information
Society   By this resolution   ECOSOC invites the Chair of the Commission on Science
and Technology for Development to establish   in an open and inclusive manner   a working
group which would seek   compile and review inputs from all Member States and all other
stakeholders on improvements to the Internet Governance Forum (IGF)   in line with the
mandate set out in the Tunis Agenda   and would make recommendations   as appropriate   to
the Commission at its fourteenth session in 2011   in a report that would constitute an input
from the Commission to the General Assembly   through ECOSOC   should the mandate of
the Internet Governance Forum be extended 
2   At its sixty-fifth session   the General Assembly decided to extend the mandate of the
IGF 1 underlining the need to improve the IGF with a view to linking it to the broader
dialogue on global Internet governance”   and decided that particular consideration should
be given to inter alia   enhancing participation from developing countries   exploring further
voluntary options for financing the Forum and improving the preparation process
modalities   and the work and functioning of the Forum s secretariat 
3   The Working Group was composed of 21 Member States   including the five
Member States that have hosted IGF meetings and the two that have hosted the World
Summit on the Information Society   In addition   five representatives from the business
community   five representatives from civil society   five representatives from the technical
and academic community and five representatives from intergovernmental organizations
were invited to participate interactively in the Working Group 2 Subsequently   the Working
Group agreed on the attendance of a representative3 of Mr   Fortunato de la Peña   Chair of
the Commission on Science and Technology for Development (CSTD)   and on the
membership of Kenya as host country of a completed IGF 4 The full list of members and
participants can be found in the annex to this report 
4   Following a number of face-to-face and online open consultations which were held
prior to the setting up of the Working Group 5 its work was carried out in two different
phases   In a first phase   two meetings were held   on 25 and 26 February 2011 in Montreux 
Switzerland 6 and on 24 and 25 March 2011 in Geneva   Switzerland 7 under the

I   Shaping the outcomes of IGF meetings
11   While maintaining the IGF as a non-binding   non-decision-making and nonduplicative
forum   it is important to improve the quality and format of IGF outcomes to
enhance the impact of the IGF on global Internet governance and policy   For this purpose   it
is necessary that IGF outcomes clearly reflect the full diversity of opinions on key policy
issues of the multi-stakeholder IGF community   In addition   more tangible and visible IGF
outcomes combined with enhanced communication tools and strategy would also improve
outreach 
The Working Group makes the following recommendations 
1   Develop more tangible outputs
12   To focus discussions   the preparation process of each IGF should formulate a
set of policy questions to be considered at the IGF   as part of the overall discussion 
The results of the debates on these questions   with special focus on public policy
perspectives and aimed at capacity-building   should be stated in the outcome
documentation 
13   The outcome documentation should include messages that map out
converging and diverging opinions on given questions 
14   The IGF should continue to produce and enhance its current reports 
including the Chair s report   the sessions  transcripts   the workshop reports and the
overall proceedings 
2   Improve the visibility of the IGF
15   Improve the visibility and availability of IGF outcomes by means of
enhanced IGF communication tools and strategy to make the relevant documents
available to all relevant stakeholders as well as the media 
II   Working modalities including open consultations   the
Multi-stakeholder Advisory Group   and the Secretariat
16   While being focused on themes and specific policy questions   it is important to
maintain the overall structure of the IGF   namely main sessions   feeder workshops 
workshops   round tables and specific policy questions   However   the working modalities of
the IGF   including open consultations   the MAG and the Secretariat   could be improved to
ensure the effective impact of IGF multi-stakeholder policy dialogue 
The Working Group makes the following recommendations 
1   Improve the overall preparatory process of the IGF
17   The IGF Secretariat and the MAG should reach out and continue to invite all
stakeholders to be more actively involved in the preparation of the IGF   including by
identifying pertinent key policy questions around which main sessions for the IGF
will be structured   In order to enhance the bottom-up process and to facilitate the
identification of key policy questions   the Secretariat could also issue the call for
workshop proposals before the first open consultation 
18   Logistics for the preparatory process should be improved   including by
retaining the practice that all of the annual consultations should allow for remote
participation 

19   Establishing a clear timetable for the preparatory process is necessary 
including for all open consultations and MAG meetings   and important dates shall
be published well in advance to enable the well-prepared participation of all
stakeholders 
2   Improve the structure and working methods of the MAG
20   The proposed selection process for the MAG 
(a) The three non-governmental stakeholder groups should propose lists
of candidates that should be balanced   including in terms of gender distribution and
in reflecting the diversity of geographical distribution   This will enable a wide range
of diversity within the MAG   especially those groups which have been
underrepresented in the MAG   and will be sufficiently large to provide some
flexibility when selecting MAG members;
(b) Stakeholder groups should identify and publicize the process which
works best for their own culture and methods of engagement and which will ensure
their self-management;
(c) The contribution of lists of proposed candidates for each stakeholder
group should not be restricted to one particular body;
(d) The final selection of candidates shall continue to be made by the
United Nations Secretary-General 
21   During the selection process the following measures should be kept in mind 
(a) The process of selection of MAG members should be inclusive 
predictable   transparent and fully documented;
(b) New MAG members should undergo an orientation process before
they participate in their first MAG meeting;
(c) The annual record of MAG physical and remote participation will be
made by the IGF Secretariat and published on the IGF website;
(d) It is important that the MAG has clear terms of reference 
3   Strengthen the Secretariat
22   The IGF Secretariat should continue to operate with transparency and
flexibility   be independent of any specific stakeholder interests   interface with all
stakeholder groups and be accountable to the broader IGF community   With very
limited human and financial resources   the IGF Secretariat   together with many
volunteers   has effectively supported IGF meetings   However   it should be
strengthened without losing its lightweight structure   as set out in the Tunis Agenda 
to ensure that it has the ability to meet increasing demands in a cost-effective and
efficient way   and to support the desired and increased outreach   including to
developing countries and particularly the least developed countries (LDCs) 
III   Funding of the IGF
23   Currently   the IGF relies on voluntary funding   including host-country and other inkind
contributions   While maintaining the present funding model   it is important to increase
voluntary funding to enhance the long-term predictability and stability of funding
contributions and create continuity of funds for the IGF activities   It is useful to explore
additional ways to encourage voluntary contributions   in particular to support participation
from developing countries and especially LDCs   Stable   predictable   and voluntary funding

should also cover remote participation management and technical expenses   The Secretariat
and the host country should work together to ensure the availability of adequate technical
and human resources   including a remote moderator   There is an integral relationship
between stable   predictable and increased voluntary funding and the implementation of
other recommendations of the Working Group 
The Working Group makes the following recommendations 
1   Encourage increased voluntary financial contributions
24   The present funding model should be continued   However   more financial
resources are needed to support the existing functions of the IGF Secretariat and to
support and enhance the participation of stakeholders from developing countries 
and in particular LDCs   All potential donors are encouraged to contribute and make
pluriannual contributions whenever possible 
25   The MAG is tasked with preparing IGF meetings   and its members can only
fulfil this task if they are able to be physically present in meetings   Efforts should be
made to fund those who are not in a position to do so 
26   One way to source additional funds would be to create a mechanism for
inviting   accepting and aggregating contributions   including smaller contributions 
that can be used specifically to broaden participation for developing countries 
particularly LDCs   in the IGF   The possibility of establishing a light non-profit
entity for this purpose should be explored 
27   Appreciation is expressed concerning the generosity of all donors to date 
Donors are encouraged to continue   and where possible   increase their contributions 
to assist in widening the donor base and to identify new mechanisms for predictable
voluntary funding   In this regard   a closer relationship with stakeholders in the
relevant fields should be explored and further encouraged 
28   Outreach and informational materials   including a letter of invitation to join
the donors developed by the Secretariat   will be useful to communicate with
potential donors 
29   The IGF Secretariat could make official announcements   via the website and
other suitable mechanisms   to explain the fund-raising process   including
information on how to contribute   as well as a description of the IGF and its
activities that will be supported by contributions 
30   The resource mobilization for the IGF should be enhanced with proactive
outreach and interaction with potential donors; in this regard   the Special Advisor on
Internet Governance to the Secretary-General and the IGF Executive Coordinator
can provide the necessary support in meeting this goal 
2   Enhance accountability and transparency
31   Annual financial reports detailing budget items   income and expenditure
should be made available to the IGF community via the website   taking into account
United Nations rules and regulations 
32   The IGF Secretariat should provide an annual update of IGF finances during
open consultations with the possibility of providing views and comments   which the
MAG may incorporate in its work and summary report 
33   There should be timely reports to donors   annually and at the end of every
project cycle   on the implementation of the project document and on the use of
funds 

3   Acknowledge the host country s support and the in-kind support from other
countries   organizations and the United Nations
34   The IGF should recognize and acknowledge the substantial contributions
from host countries throughout the hosting of the global IGF   which include
significant financial and in-kind voluntary efforts such as providing services for the
use of remote hubs and remote participants   as well as audio-visual and ICT
requirements as per host country agreements   Such acknowledgments should be
discussed with each host country 
35   The IGF should also recognize and acknowledge verifiable in-kind voluntary
efforts to the planning and organizing process from other countries   organizations 
and the United Nations   including support for participation   the hosting of remote
hubs and remote participation services   as well as audio-visual and ICT
requirements 
IV   Broadening participation and capacity-building
36   Although participation in the IGF has increased with time   it should be further
broadened   both at the annual meeting and in its preparatory phase   to involve new
stakeholders   in particular from developing countries and especially LDCs   and persons
with disabilities and other underrepresented groups   Broadening participation enhances the
IGF s openness and inclusiveness and fosters effective multi-stakeholder policy dialogue
and productive capacity-building   For this purpose   questions related to existing obstacles
that limit greater involvement should be addressed   It is important to acknowledge that
remote participation is now an integral part of the IGF and that adequate resources should
be made available to develop this activity further 
The Working Group makes the following recommendations 
1   Expand and diversify participation
37   Support for participation of all stakeholder groups from developing countries 
in particular LDCs   in the IGF and its preparatory process should be further
enhanced 
38   More topics addressing issues related to Internet governance for development
should be included in the agenda to make it more interesting for participants from
developing countries   in particular LDCs   thereby encouraging them to enhance their
participation 
39   The selection of workshops is important and they should be made more
relevant and inclusive 
40   Increased financial support for stakeholders who are currently not able to
participate with their own resources is necessary   Where possible   special funding
and other means of support for developing-country participants   in particular those
from LDCs   should be increased   It is also important to encourage fellowship
programmes supported by participating organizations 
41   Mechanisms to broaden participation should be encouraged   and such efforts
should be ongoing and transparent with regular reports provided by the IGF
Secretariat on progress made and obstacles faced 

2   Enhance measures for broader participation
42   Remote participation is an integral part of the IGF   While remote
participation has improved   in particular through remote moderators and hubs   there
is still room for improvement in the following areas 
(a) The Secretariat should continue to ensure the availability of adequate
technical and human resources   including remote moderators;
(b) Chairs and moderators should give remote and on-site participants
equal recognition and the opportunity to participate;
(c) Low-bandwidth connections to remote participation tools should be
accommodated;
(d) Linguistic diversity in remote participation should be fostered by
ensuring that online meeting platforms interface with on-site interpretation;
(e) Mechanisms that facilitate remote participation   such as live
transcripts   should be kept as an integral part of the IGF   Such mechanisms are
invaluable not only to remote participants   but also to non-English-speakers and to
people with disabilities   whether they are on site or not 
43   It is important to ensure the accessibility of the IGF s facilities to persons
with disabilities 
44   To improve participation in the IGF of diverse linguistic and cultural groups 
it is important to expand linguistic diversity functions in the work of the IGF   For
example   this could be achieved by (resources permitting) 
(a) Increasing the translation of key documents into United Nations
official languages;
(b) Exploring the use of simultaneous machine translations based on realtime
English transcripts;
(c) Encouraging the use of any of the United Nations official languages 
not only English   as the working language in some workshops 
3   Improve the online visibility and accessibility of the IGF
45   A first step in this direction should be to enhance the IGF s website by
providing interactive functionalities and making it more attractive and inclusive   It
should also maintain its conformance with open standards and further improve
accessibility to persons with disabilities 
46   It is important to continue to encourage host countries to make information
about logistics (e g   low-cost accommodation   transportation between airports and
hotels   shuttling between hotels and meeting venues) available in a timely manner on
their websites 
4   Enhance all stakeholders  understanding of the IGF and Internet governance
issues
47   The role of the IGF as a one-stop shop” where people can increase their
knowledge and understanding of the IGF and Internet governance issues should be
strengthened   This could be done   for instance   by introducing a structured track of
pre-events and events at the Forum that contribute to capacity-building in Internet
governance 

48   All bodies dealing with Internet governance should be invited to participate 
in a coordinated and cooperative manner   in the one-stop shop” track of the IGF
which contributes to capacity-building on Internet governance 
49   Orientation is important to better engage newcomers to the IGF and to create
an environment where their participation becomes the most useful for them and also
for other participants   Existing mechanisms to orientate newcomers should be
continued and strengthened   This could be done by encouraging stakeholders 
initiatives to document the IGF   including concerning best practices   with related
links on the IGF website   The establishment of an Internet Governance Observatory
is also encouraged 
50   Taking into account the need to increase the participation of all stakeholders 
and in particular representatives of governments and parliamentarians to further
broaden their interactions with other stakeholders at the IGF   a broad strategy could
be developed to encourage their attendance   including possibly by organizing a
special session during the IGF for them 
V   Linking the IGF to other Internet governance-related entities
51   It is important for the IGF to continue and improve its interaction and
communication with other Internet governance-related entities in order to further global
policy dialogue   This goal can be achieved by developing a defined outreach and
communication strategy 
The Working Group makes the following recommendations 
1   Ensure the relevance and inclusiveness of annual IGFs
52   The IGF is encouraged to continue and extend its interaction and
communication with Internet governance-related entities in order to further develop
the global policy dialogue 
53   The IGF Secretariat and the MAG should continue to improve the sharing of
information related to the chosen policy questions for each annual IGF and its
outcome documentation   with relevant Internet governance-related entities 
54   The IGF Secretariat and the MAG should further share information with
relevant Internet governance-related entities about how they can contribute to and
participate in the IGF 
2   Support enhanced communication
55   The communication should be improved between the IGF and relevant
Internet governance-related entities   For example   it is important to improve linkages
between the IGF and the CSTD   by requesting space in CSTD meetings to present
information about IGF activities 
3   Empower the MAG and the IGF Secretariat to do consistent outreach
56   It is important to encourage better communication and interactions between national
and regional IGF initiatives and the IGF   and to promote and enhance linkages with
national and regional IGF initiatives   This should be achieved by consistent and active
outreach to these initiatives by the IGF Secretariat   In addition   the MAG should ensure that
national and regional IGF initiatives have adequate opportunities to feed into the IGF 

This submission proposes a new principle for the governance of the Internet 

The principle can be stated as follows 

 

"Everyone should have the right to express oneself   self-organize and engage in politically-oriented collective action on the Internet   as means of enacting digital citizenship 

 

No-one should be discriminated on the basis of ideas of political nature expressed and/or shared online   Tactics of collective action which include disruption of services but do not damage the infrastructure should be tolerated as legitimate and democratic practices of digital citizenship   Arbitrary or indiscriminate censorship   generalized   unjustified or dispropotionate surveillance on contents and users   and practices aimed at restricting access to the Internet and its contents shall not be tolerated "

 

The principle is intended to support and protect the expression of political opinions and preferences by individuals and groups and the resulting online collective action dynamics against the forms of blanket surveillance   censorship and discrimination enacted by States across the globe 

 

Internet   in its quality of global resource of public interest   is an inexpensive and user-friendly instrument to enact democratic citizenship in the digital domain   As a malleable   flexible   and constantly evolving space for interaction and aggregation   it is gradually becoming the largest public space mankind has ever seen” [1]   It offers tools to facilitate direct participation of citizens in the cultural and political life of their own country and of the world as a global village   For the above reasons   the Internet can be a vehicle for emancipation and the promotion of fundamental freedoms; at the same time   it can foster democratization processes   contributing to create a more equitable society However   in order to empower people to take full advantage of the opportunities for exchange and self-expression that Internet makes available   we must safeguard their right to freedom of expression and self-organization through and on the Internet   both as expression of bottom-up democratic participation and mechanism of social innovation 

 

In a time in which States increasingly invade the private sphere of citizens with the complicity of the corporate sector turned into a regulatory agent at the service of security and enforcement agencies   it appears crucial to safeguard the right of individuals and groups to organize and collectively take action in the digital domain    

 

Self-organization is an answer to the contemporary surveillance overreach and to the current State-centric approach that considers citizens as potential suspects   The latter is a negative and prejudicial approach to security   one that harms citizens   distorts the mechanism of due process   and weakens the very same security measures States intend to promote 

 

We would like to propose a different approach that puts citizens and their rights at the centre of security measures an approach able to empower people on the Internet   instead of disempowering them   and that returns to people the right to defend themselves online   In this way we would put at the center of the definition of security and of its measures the human rights to freedom of expression and privacy   and the principle that security means primarily the protection of the rights of many above potential partial interests 

 

This approach would promote mutual restraint and oversight amongst the many actors invested in people s surveillance (States   business actors   etc )   and would shift the current cybersecurity model from a State-centric to a people-centric approach 

Section 2   Roadmap for the Further Evolution of the Internet Governance Ecosystem
 
1   Current critical IG issues

 

Public policy issues that relate to the internet are not finite 

 

They will emerge and change over time   Some will stand out as priorities at certain times   as does at present   surveillance   The diversity of these issues is such that it would not be feasible to centralise decision-making about them 

 

The internet does not exist in a parallel dimension   It is part of social   economic   cultural   personal and political life   A more appropriate manner for phrasing this question would be What relevant international public policy issues do NOT pertain to the internet in any way in today s world 

 

Nevertheless   there are a number of key issues that are currently attracting attention which the NetMundial could address 

 

i Internationalisation of DNS and Root management Some internet governance bodies such as ICANN and IANA are not fully internationalised   Note that by  internationalised  we do not mean to propose oversight by national governmental entities   but still required is the involvement of ALL countries   While on the one hand internet management is distributed   power and influence of this management has remains concentrated   Efforts should be directed to better coordination and inclusion   rather than centralisation   For concrete proposals on how to do this we endorse the submission by Avri Doria available at http //content netmundial br/contribution/one-possible-roadmap-for-iana-evolution/153

 

ii   Consolidating democratic   inclusive   multistakeholder internet governance processes Many governments are still fundamentally uncomfortable with the WSIS principle that the management of the internet needed to involve  all stakeholders    The term multistakeholder is still used quite loosely   and some of the challenges that come with multistakeholder processes   such as dealing with conflict of interest and ensuring pluralism   need to be addressed   Multistakeholder processes need to be improved where they exist   and established where they don t 

 

iii   Uncertainty about the future of the IGF This is related to the previous point   While the United Nations-based IGF   the most long-running   large scale and successful experiment in multistakeholder internet policy debate and dialogue remains insecure   and under-resourced   the future of multistakeholder participation in internet policy will remain uncertain 

 

iv   Network neutrality   and how this complex concept is evolving in the context of increased convergence of internet   telecoms   broadcasting and content services and applications   The impact of international and national consolidation in these sectors creating combined media and network service providers which have the power dominate markets   is of particular concern here 

 

v   Fair and transparent cross-border regulation and taxation of global internet businesses that ensures competition and choice for users   and while supporting local laws and  in-country  business interests 

 

vi   States acting to limit freedom of expression and association on the internet   Many governments are engaged in internet filtering and censorship   Some are manufacturing and exporting the devices used to do this   Some even order operators to shut down the internet   or the telecommunications networks the public use to access the internet   This fragments the internet   creates a heightened sense of insecurity and violates human rights 

 

vii   Mass surveillance and privacy   Data mining and exploitation of the personal data and behaviour of internet users has given rise to innovative business models   but it urgently needs to be contained   and very carefully managed   It is out of control and taking place with no or little concern for the fundamental rights of individuals   Legislation dealing with data protection   internet intermediary liability   and interception monitoring and surveillance needs to be revised to ensure robust protection for human rights 

 

viii   Security on the internet is essential   but the prevailing approach places the security of States   narrowly defined by the security sector   before the security of the internet itself   and of internet users   Journalists   human rights defenders and whistleblowers who expose corruption and the abuse of power cannot be effective if they do not have access to a secure internet 

 

ix   Cyberdisarmament   The open collaborative nature of the internet is antithetical to using it to attack   By its very nature it is vulnerable because it is a trust-based network   Efforts to fight crimes committed on the internet are important and legitimate   and require collaboration among states   and among law enforcement agencies and other stakeholders   Good progress is being made in this regard   The issue we raise here is different   It is the increasing militarization of the internet and the development of means to attack it at an infrastructure level   Some governments appear to be developing units that can commit cyberwar   or use cyberspace for military purposes   This all undermines its integrity   security and potential to benefit humanity   We need States to commit to cyberpeace” and to cyberdisarmament 

 
2   Existing IG forums and bodies dealing with policy or technical outcomes

 

Policy development involves research   consultation   networking   drafting and debate and dialogue   There are multiple policy development forums   and   as we said above   the range of public policy issues pertaining to the internet are so broad that expecting one forum or body to develop all internet-related policy would be very problematic 

 

Some of the existing forums and bodies involved in internet policy include 

 

i   The IGF is an established process for multistakeholder internet policy dialogue   It has a mandate to be more outcome-oriented from ECOSOC via the CSTD WG on IGF improvements and in early 2014 the Internet Society (ISOC) proposed that the IGF develops policy recommendations which can then be considered for adoption by IG bodies or governments   Many civil society entities had made similar proposals previously 

 

ii   National efforts   More countries address internet policy issues at national level   Some have established ministries or departments   and some   as is the case in Brazil   a multistakeholder body to deal with internet policies (CGI br) 

 

iii   International intergovernmental bodies such as the World Intellectual Property Organisation and the Human Rights Council (to mention just two) deals with internet related issues   The HRC has passed several resolutions related to the internet in the last few years   Another example is the UN Counter-Terrorism Implementation Task Force   appointed by the UN Secretary General   which addresses policy related to  cyber terrorism  

 

iv   Regional inter-governmental bodies such as the European Commission and the African Union Commission address a wide range of internet policy issues   as do the regional United Nations Economic Commissions   An example of an improved existing mechanisms is the implementation of the eLAC2015   the Information Society Plan for Latin America and the Caribbean (CEPAL/ECLAC) to which all governments in the region are signatories and in which non-govermental stakeholders have been formally included   In Africa the regional commission   UNECA   acts as the secretariat for multi-stakeholder forums such as the African IGF   At a subregional level   regional economic bodies such as the Southern African Development Community (SADC) and the Union of West African States (ECOWAS) have developed internet-related policies to support their member states   such as in the area of cyber-security and infrastructure deployment 

 

v   Internet specific institutions such as ICANN   and others involved in the technical coordinaton of the internet   such as ISOC and the numbering organisations   As these are well-known and their roles already well documented we will not elaborate on them further   They work well   but their accountability   transparency and degree of inclusiveness can improve   In particular   as we have said above   ICANN needs to internationalise fully   and to ensure that it does not exceed its current role   and that it strengthens civil society participation 
 
3   How and why are these issues not being adequately dealt with by these forums or organizations 

 

There is a vibrant and diverse internet governance ecosystem at work 

 

The challenges are that (1) All parts of this ecosystem are not adequately inclusive   transparent and accountable   (2) they do not communicate and collaborate with one another adequately   and (3) power and influence in this ecosystem and its components are very unevenly distributed 

 

It is important to look at communication   collaboration   participation   power and influence in both the ecosystem and its components   This is neither a trivial exercise nor a once-off exercise   the  health  of the ecosystem should be evaluated continuously   A role we believe a strengthened IGF will be well-suited to 

 

Contributing factors to the above three problem areas are 

 

i   The absence of commonly accepted principles for internet governance at both substantive and procedural levels   There is not even a common understanding on what the internet is from an economic or legal perspective 

 

ii   The absence of a clear conceptual approach to internet governance   For example   when IG is discussed   distinctions are not made between governance   policy and regulation   and management and coordination 

 

iii   Lack of maturity in some multistakeholder bodies   For example   stakeholder identification and representation can be fairly adhoc and mechanisms to guard against conflict of interest are not strong enough 

 

iv   Unequal distribution of power among governments in global internet governance spaces   Decisions are often shaped by these power configurations rather than by a desire to achieve the best possible public interest outcomes 

 

v   Limited resources   financial   time   capacity and knowledge among stakeholders that care about internet governance   but who are not centrally involved 

 

vi Different approaches by governments to inclusive and multistakeholder policy processes with some very unwilling to involve civil society and others unwilling to involve business entities 

 

vii   Lack of resources to optimise the IGF   the most inclusive policy forum currently in existence   which influences global and national internet policies directly and indirectly   The IGF could play a far more effective role in facilitating collaboration and communications within the internet governance ecosystem if it had sufficient capacity and resources 

 

viii   Assumptions that models that work in the technical coordination of the internet can be replicated for addressing broader public policies 

 

ix   Clear gender imbalance among those who participate in current internet governance arrangements   Limited participation by women must be addressed

 
4   Possible responses to these challenges

 

Rather than create new policy-making or oversight mechanisms we recommend the following 

 

i   International agreement (formal and informal) that internet governance is distributed and that it has to be viewed as an ecosystem and that centralising it is neither feasible   nor desirable   While this growing ecosystem risks being overly complex and opaque   it also increases depth   diversity   and the opportunity for participation and creative problem solving 

 

ii   Renewal of IGF by the UN General Assembly for 10 years rather than the current 5   This will allow it to work on a longer cycle and be more effective in implementing is mandate and constantly improving while doing so 

 

iii   Strengthen the IGF to enable it to facilitate communication   deliberation and collaboration for the broader IG ecosystem   This will also facilitate the process of identifying issues that are not currently being addressed effectively by existing mechanisms   Financial resources could come from   among other sources   revenues from gTLD domain name registrations   and be used to facilitate developing country participation   The IGF has evolved into a regional   national and global process which is linked to the UN   but is also independent   It is inclusive   Its value should not be underestimated 

 

One concrete suggestion that would address the above challenges and strengthen the IGF is to establish an IGF-linked information clearing house and policy observatory or for the IGF to work closely with other such clearing houses and policy observatories   such as the European Commission s proposed Global Internet Policy Observatory 

 

iv   Achieve broad agreement on principles for internet governance; principles that have the broadest possible public interest and respect for fundamental human rights at their core   and that affirm accountable   transparent and inclusive decision-making process 

 

v   Strengthen meaningful participation of developing country stakeholders in existing mechanisms 

 

vi   Improve government recognition of the value of nongovernmental stakeholder participation in public policy making   Public policy   including internet public policy   cannot be implemented by governments alone and implementation will be more effective if these stakeholders are involved in the development of policy in the first place 

 

vii   Empower civil society engagement within existing mechanisms at national   regional and global levels   Civil society heterogeneity must be recognised as a strength and existing mechanisms must ensure that modalities for participation provide ample space for the diversity of voices in civil society to be heard 

 

viii   Inclusion of women in internet governance spaces must be measured   and concrete action taken if the results indicate unequal participation 

 

ix   Develop codes of practice for internet governance processes and bodies which provide guidelines and a monitoring framework for ensuring that they are transparent   accountable   participative and accessible   APC has worked on such a tool and developed   in partnership with the Council of Europe and UNECE   the Code of good practice on information   participation and transparency in internet governance   The Code continues to a be living document and as such is a work in progress   More information about it is available http //www intgovcode org/index php/Main_Page We recommend that a useful practical action for the NetMundial meeting would be to propose and support further work on this Code and we are ready and willing to assist in such a task 

 

x   Existing bodies to avoid  mission creep    Institutions with power and resources should avoid expanding their current scope without exhaustive consultation with the broader internet community 

 

xi   Establish national multistakeholder forums and processes for dealing with IG and internet policy issues   and ensuring that they include marginalised voices 

 

xii   Capacity building initiatives including   but not limited to   continuing and strengthening the capacity building tracks and pre-events at regional and global IGFs 

 

xiii   Clarify the role of governments Governments have special responsibilities under international human rights law as bearers of duties to respect   protect and promote human rights   They also have the responsibility to protect and promote the public interest   which requires them to a) Consult widely and be participative in the development of local internet policy;b) Respect the role and responsibility of civil society to challenge governments   including in international fora;c) Convene and support inclusive multi-stakeholder internet governance processes at national level;d) Bring sufficient political will to bear so that cooperation emerging from these processes does not stagnate;e)   Establish transparency and accountability mechanisms to enable public scrutiny of their decisions and positions on internet governance;f) Take steps to ensure that businesses meet human rights standards (for example   in line with the United Nations guidelines on human rights and business)

 

xiv   We also recommend that governments 

 

a) Participate actively in global   regional and national IGFs and in other multistakeholder internet governance mechanisms   The burden (which can be substantial) of such participation can be lightened by government collaboration with other stakeholder groups;c) Uphold transparency and multi-lateral agreements   and avoid internet-related agreements that undermine the principle of governments operating on an equal footing and with transparency   Examples of the type of agreement that should be avoided are ACTA   and more recently   the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade agreements which are not publicly negotiated within the international system 

 

xv   Consider new mechanisms to address specific issues if the need arises IG stakeholders and bodies should identify public policy issues without a clear home   and whether they are best dealt with through a single institution or forum   or through a distributed model In some instances there might be a need for a new mechanism to be established to address specific issues which have emerged   such as   for example   to address and prevent the rights violations that result from mass surveillance by governments   working with corporations   We would still recommend first exploring whether   for example   existing human rights mechanisms cannot play the needed role before opting for the creation of new mechanisms 

 
5   How these possible responses will ensure stability   resilience and efficiency and also comply with principles of equitable multistakeholder participation   accountability   transparency and predictability 

 

* Achieving consensus on basic principles for internet governance will enable the development or adoption of a code of good practice   and monitoring framework that can be used for both self   peer and bottom-up assessment of the extent to which IG mechanisms and processes are effectively democratising and acting in the public interest 

 

* Adoption of such principles at international intergovernmental level can consolidate recognition that the internet is a global resource   of benefit to all humanity and that governance of the internet should therefore involve all stakeholders   and not be reduced to haggling or horse trading based on narrow national interests or geopolitical conflicts   but based on international agreements such as the Universal Declaration on Human Rights and the International Covenants on civil and political and on economic   cultural and social rights;

 

* Accepting the distributed  ecosystem  approach to internet governance will pave the way for positive evolution through ongoing collaborative learning   evaluation and debate   provided it is effectively inclusive and  multi-stakeholder  in its nature   transparent   accountable and accessible 

 

* A stronger   longer term IGF   either hosting or linked to an information clearing house   and mechanisms and resources to strengthen the participation of developing country governments   will be able to continue its role as a forum for debate and dialogue   but also play a more dynamic and responsive role in facilitating communication   and cooperation within the IG ecosystem 

 

* Consolidating the multistakeholder approach and making it more democratic   participative   effective and consistent   will enable the constructive evolution of the ecosystem 

 

We also endorse the Best Bits roadmap submission http //bestbits net/netmundial-roadmap/ and the Korean Civil Society Submission http //content netmundial br/contribution/korean-civil-society-submission-for-netmundial/146

1    We support the spirit of the Montevideo Statement on the Future of Internet Cooperation   where it recommends 

The need for ongoing efforts to address Internet Governance challenges   and to catalyze community-wide efforts towards the evolution of global multi-stakeholder Internet cooperation 

The need to accelerate the globalization of ICANN and IANA functions   towards an environment in which all stakeholders   including all governments and other under represented actors participate on an equal footing 

2   We call for further outreach activities by Internet governance institutions and their relevant community members after the NetMundial Meeting to foster dialogue among wider stakeholders at regional   national and local levels   The results of these dialogues shall be brought to the global debate 

3   We ask all stakeholder who are already involved in Internet Governance policy dialogue - government   private sector and the technical community in particular - to take more proactive measures to recognize and support the participation from the marginalized groups/stakeholders including those from developing parts of the world as well as from broader members of the civil society 

4   Strengthening financial support for their participation to global dialogue such as IGF   ICANN or W3C is one essential measure to be seriously pursued   Financial resources to support IGF operation and its Secretariat should be seriously enhanced 

5   The operating institutions managing the critical Internet resources such as domain names and IP addresses registries and registrars and their umbrella institutions (ICANN   RIRs)   as well as providers of public communication infrastructure and services who receive fee and make revenues out of these activities should make additional effort to share these burdens   Global TLD registries (both existing  com    org    net and new gTLDs) in particular   should provide further financial contributions in an open and transparent manner   Financial support from national registries should also be provided to enhance the multistakeholder participation at both local and global levels since their revenue source essentially come from all stakeholders and users of the Internet 

 

6   In order to reach global consensus on new oversight and policy development framework on ICANN/IANA functions   we suggest to set up Working Groups consist of all stakeholders with geographic   gender and other diversity considerations to come up with possible alternatives to be considered at the coming IGF 2015 process

Two principles   from history – and forward

ROADMAP

Abstract
History   recent and past   teaches two principles for Internet governance   Then the
opposed camps who have so far stalemated movement can   individually   build from these
principles to devolve a framework and roadmap forward 
Document
Principles
Sound principles grow from human experience and history   Let us suggest that history
promulgates two seminal principles   for Internet governance   From these two starting
points   then further guidance may become clear 
The proximate history spans the recent couple decades   beginning as the world stirred   to
account the growing Internet phenomenon   Much longer human history has given us hardwon
wisdom   for governance that suits our natures 
The recent decades have been punctuated by   first the US Clinton
administration s incorporating a names-and-numbers actor   then a decade
ago the two WSIS summits   and recently WCIT   Stretching back prior to
any formal steps   two implacably opposed camps have   over these couple
of decades and to this day   frozen a stalemate 
Meanwhile   much longer history teaches some governance fundamentals 
From this summation   two principles arise 
One   the first principle Governance must be democratic   The Englishman Churchill said it
succinctly   Democracy is the worst form of government – except all the others that have
been tried  (Namely   all the others as result of which man has died   over eons   to escape )
That requires   specifically   governance by democratic states   duly elected and – most
especially – faithfully responsive to their citizens   With the Internet global   that means
governance by regional and global democratic mechanisms   Thus in the case of the
Internet   democratic governments   together and in concert   regionally and globally   are to
exercise policy discretion and then execute policy for the Internet 
Pointedly   this precludes all stakeholders on a common footing  Arising from the
compromises that drove WSIS   some provisions in the Tunis Agenda proved to need
tidying up   going forward 
All stakeholders   over long history   have played their manifold roles in a society   The
present coining of the notion   multistakeholderism   helps highlight the importance of
society-wide contributions to a process of policy formation   Following on that process 
democratic states then decide policy   and implement 
Two   the second principle Free expression must be inviolate 
History has taught 
Free flow of information is the fundamental enabler for innovation   In
particular   freely flowing innovation gave birth to the Internet and could
continue to propel its cornucopia for a better life   Around the world   for all 
if not stymied 
Free flow is necessary for the medium to connect all mankind   around the
world   for the possibilities that a world connection may catalyze   With
perhaps the prospect for consensus where it matters 
Not least   free expression is linchpin for the fluid community dialogue that
necessarily underpins democracy 
Roadmap
While this piece begins as a dialogue about principles   for NETmundial   the two principles
also set the stage for a framework   for evolution   To begin a roadmap toward governance
mechanisms that embody the principles 
As the two principles derive from history   they also offer guidance for the two camps who
presently stalemate evolution 
For the camp that has so far enshrined multistakeholderism Only
democratic states govern suitably   including for Internet governance 
History insists 
For the camp that has degraded free expression History rejects the
practice 
Note that acknowledgement – individually   within each camp – of each camp s separate
mandate   as derived above from the two principles   can free up progress toward a
framework   If each camp acts on its separate mandate   as above   each may
accommodate   and perhaps find the possibility to join with   the other camp 
Ultimately   the principles devolve to global mechanisms for Internet governance that serve
both camps and   more to the point   that will serve all 

The Center for Democracy & Technology (CDT) is pleased to submit the following comments to the NETmundial Global Multistakeholder Meeting on the Future of Internet Governance   This submission responds to issue # 2 on the Roadmap for the Further Evolution of the Internet Governance Ecosystem 
CDT welcomes the decision by the Brazilian government to host the upcoming NETmundial meeting   The meeting should be a useful opportunity to review some of the persistent and sometimes problematic issues central to the future of the Internet governance and related public policy discussions   The meeting seeks to encourage and explore ways in which the Internet governance ecosystem might change   which   if done so for the right reasons   could bring about appropriate and constructive evolution 
As we all engage in this process CDT urges a measured and reflective approach 
The Internet has become an enabler of the success of nations   has empowered persons around the globe in ways unimagined and continues to encourage and facilitate endless innovation and creativity   It is   as the NETmundial website suggests   a global platform for social   economic and human development and a catalyzer to exercise human rights  Therefore   changes to the Internet and its governance must sustain and enhance the benefits of this medium 
The successful evolution of the Internet as a global network has depended on a flexible   decentralized   bottom-up and issue-driven set of interrelated governance processes that are open to participation by all stakeholders   CDT believes that change should not occur solely for sake of change   or as a response to pressures of a particular stakeholder group (or some subset thereof)   Changes should not be driven by agendas that seek to diminish the evolving roles and responsibilities of non-governmental stakeholders   CDT believes that proposals to unduly increase the role of governments in Internet governance will only exacerbate governance challenges rather than lessen them 
A case in point is the past year s on-going revelations about the scope of surveillance activity by the US   the UK   and other governments   CDT opposes and seeks substantive changes to the mass surveillance regimes of states but does not believe that issues of Internet governance and surveillance should be conflated   While some try to point to mass surveillance as an example of the supposed failure of the current Internet governance ecosystem   the revelations have   in fact   exposed exactly the opposite the processes that led to the development of these surveillance practices demonstrate the danger of governments retreating from open and participatory policy development processes 
The NETmundial website suggests that responses to furthering the evolution of the Internet governance ecosystem should seek to ensure the stability   resilience and efficiency and also comply with principles of equitable multi-stakeholder participation   accountability   transparency and predictability  CDT completely agrees   and suggests that any proposed change   evolution or addition to the existing Internet governance ecosystem must be the result of agreed
processes that should include   at a minimum 
  multi-stakeholder consultations
  open   inclusive and transparent processes
  identification of real (not perceived) and practical needs that are substantiated through credible research and analysis
  constructive and proportionate solutions
  multi-stakeholder endorsement   and
  implementation that is accountable   transparent and subject to review 
CDT notes that implementation of any proposed changes to the governance system should not necessarily require a legislative acts or similar hard law approaches   Nor should implementation necessitate international treaties or intergovernmental structures   A diversity of mechanisms exists and we have no doubt that the Internet s evolution will bring about further innovation in governance processes and mechanisms 
Any proposed change or solution should also be understood and agreed by all stakeholders as credibly enhancing the Internet through furthering
  resilience
  interoperability
  reliability
  global reach and scalability
  openness
  decentralization
  accessibility
  end-user control   and
  distributed and inclusive (multi-stakeholder) governance 
These criteria are essential to the future evolution of the Internet and its continued success and are recognized as such in the following Internet principles and policy documents   among others 
  The CGI br Principles for the Governance and the Use of the Internet on Universality (number 3)   Innovation (5)   and functionality   security and stability (8)
  The OECD Principles for Internet Policy Making on Promoting the open   distributed and Interconnected nature of the Internet
  The Council of Europe Declaration on Internet Governance Principles on the Universality of the Internet   the Integrity of the Internet and Architectural Principles 
Whether we are talking about strengthening the Internet Governance Forum   globalizing ICANN   bringing other stakeholders into the London Process or improving or establishing other fora and/or mechanisms   proposals for change must be credible   practical and have as their intent the continued openness   vibrancy and reach of the Internet 
Finally   the globalization of ICANN and the IANA function will no doubt be the focus of much attention at the NETmundial meeting   As the globalization of ICANN continues (through opening offices and increasing its presence internationally) it is essential that there be fuller discussion of feasible proposals/roadmaps for the future of the IANA function (and its oversight)   Any proposals for change in the core functions or role of ICANN should be subject to robust evaluative processes and be required to meet key criteria such as those outlined above; they should not be imposed from above or by one stakeholder grouping (whether internal or external)   Change must preserve and improve upon ICANN s open and transparent processes; multi-stakeholder bodies derive their legitimacy and credibility in part from their transparent processes and ability to reach consensus   And   it goes without saying that any proposed change to core operational elements of the management and functioning of the Internet must be assessed with the greatest of care and considerable caution 
CDT encourages the NETmundial meeting to find constructive   innovative and multi-stakeholder ways of furthering the evolution of the Internet governance ecosystem that are based upon a common understanding among all stakeholders of the imperative of enhancing the Internet s resiliency   global reach   openness   distributed governance and unique capacity to empower the exercise of human rights 

Through technology and science   humanity is continuously extending its reach into reality s physical   non-physical   and societal mechanics   In this way it also extends its architectonical point of view   which leads to a slow   paradigmatic evolution that has   as everything   its continuities   and saliencies or discontinuities   The points of inflexion from which things will necessarily change can be called singularities 

 

Such a singularity occurred when Copernicus understood the Revolutions of the Celestial Spheres"; another in 1889 when Henri Poincaré showed the mathematic impossibility to resolve the n-body problem in a finite time   initiating what could be called the 20th century architectonic revolution   i e   relativity   quantum physic   etc   including the digital renormalization (replacing infinitesimality by disruption) and networking (meshing of complexity)   Another singularity has most probably occurred that this debate intends to manage the no-return point of humanity s use of the communicating information processors   This has transformed humanity from an anthropic society into an anthropobotic society   where the bot is a software application that runs automated tasks over the Internet   or more generally throughout the resulting digisphere 

 
Cybernetics in perspective

 

 

Man created machines in his own image   says Norbert Wiener   Humans also created them for the convenience of some   Our task is to make them for the convenience of all and everyone   being physical or cybernetic (i e   monolectic one action   one response)   logical (i e   dialectic two premises   one conclusion) or agorical (like in an open agora of free people many meshed dynamics   one emergence)   This means to write the Human Mechanical Rights and enforce them   in particular in using their intellition (intrinsic intelligence) force   i e   the ethitechnical way we design and use the physical   logical and agorical machines   along the Dr Lessig s many time verified adage code is law" 

In so doing   we can be helped by a reflection on the technical homogeneity of theoretical   political   and societal metaphors   The incredible development of the technologies of information and communication is rooted in Shannon s entropic/negentropic Information Theory   Analysis of the seven communication states can help I sleep   I listen   I talk with mine [e g   family]   I talk [monologue   monocracy]   I talk to you [dialogue   democracy]   We talk to us [polylogue   polycracy]   We talk [consensus   symbiocracy]   In particular   symbiocracy has not been studied very much   except in the case of space or castaway settlers our problem is that we are settlers in the cyberspace with the additional factor that we are a crowd of geographically   culturally   linguistically   politically   economically   and technically   strongly structured people 

 
The internet project

 

 

The internet project initially capitalized on two preceding contributions (TCP/IP and Catenet) and politically competed with two parallel ones   which initially led to the global network deployment (Tymnet and OSI)   which meant to technically integrate with any other innovation (cf   EIN 48)   This second motivation of the internet project has been over delayed by the politically/commercially unilaterally advantageous procrastination called the status quo"   If one were to characterize the first and the second internet motivation   one could say that the first motivation belongs to a super user hierarchic vision of system control   access and security   and that the second motivation belongs to their approach along an informed   capable   and intelligent user ("IUser") that is a more complex   but much more powerful vision 

 

The choice is architectonically political   It consists in defining an esthetic for the cyberspace (and thereby the ethic to attain it)   The mechanism will necessarily be in both cases based on an international multi-stakeholder adhesion that can also be called globalization   The difference is in the decision mode either along the logic of a national   multilateral mentor possibly concerted with commercial leaders   or along the emergence of a common agoric   The initial international deployment (Tymnet) was agoric (the term comes from its designer) and interfaced all the other technologies (X 25/75   TCP/IP   SNA   Swift   SITA   etc )   It then moved to multilateral mentoring through CCITT (ITU) X 75/25   Today   national mentoring (USG contract with ICANN) is to guaranty the DNS Class IN stability 

 
ICANN

 

 

The difficulty of the ICANN US national mentoring   even globalized   is at least fivefold 

 

· Multi-Stakeholderism corresponds to a personal polycratic attitude   In monocracy   one delegates decisions to a mentor by obedience   In democracy   one shares decisions by vote   In polycracy   one makes decisions in applying them after mutual information their effect   together with that of the others   results in emerging moods 

 

· Technically   the service provided by ICANN is middle-grade   has not contributed to the protection of US citizen privacy   is not necessary even in order to use the ICANN limited vision of the internet   and politically costly limits the capacities of the internet and the freedom of innovation 

 

· Cyber-sovereignty is a complex issue because (1) a national cyber territory is virtual and global (2) commercial infra-sovereignties develop that tend to become transnational or multinational   (3) the global nature of the virtual cyber territories is not consistently and adequately considered by the geographical nation-states which need to consider   implement and support a global   multitechnological and multilingual relation-state approaches 

 

· Nation states have emerged and stabilized during the 16th/17th century in their Westphalian approach   from their Greek vision of the City   They kept the Aristotelian vision of equating architectonics with politics   The Chief of State (Archon eponymous) is sided by a Basileus Archon for the interior issues and the Polemach Archon for the exterior issues   Architectonic is assimilated with land and city planning and urbanisms 

 

This is no longer the case today the fifth (cyber) environment/battlefield is first to engineer   deciding on its national future   An Architarch Archon is to manage this ulterior    along the precautionary principle   in order to avoid further catastrophes and conflicts   The international normative debate was already a technical colonization tool (internationalization of national standard to reach a favorable global norm); it is becoming a counterwar issue where precautionary doctrine   strategies   and forces are to prevent cyberwars and digital vulnerabilities 

 

Can the national architectonic choice only be on an MS or a monarchic basis   and not democratically approved  The WSIS Geneva declaration has decided on a consensual over all esthetic in committing to an information society that had to be people centered    à caratère humain    centrada en la persona  

 

· Privacy and security are to be increasingly confronted with the intellition challenge   Intellition can be defined as intrinsic information   It can be obtained without communication by pure intelligent inference   This is the purpose of data processing   artificial intelligence   and big data   To obtain unavailable   non-communicated   hidden   remote   etc   information by inference between the data on the data (metadata) we have and the conditional links we know (syllodata) between the linked data we have   One can protect access to data; one cannot prevent others from being intelligent 

 

The Internet experience

 

We created languages   scripting   money   mathematics   etc   The internet is the first man-made physical universal   We have no previous experience in managing a system of this size   but we know that 

 

· globalization is going to ask many other systems to be governed like the internet (energy   water   pollution   health   food   economy   etc ) so that it is a test-bed   we partly control the development   for us to learn about global governances (or most probably intergovernance)

 

· the architectural principles of the internet in RFC 1122   1958   3439   5895 are good practical advises on the way to proceed   as they document the constitution of something that is structuring today s world   One of the non-written lessons of these RFCs is that complexity is a constant simplification of a network of simple things   and the opposite of complication 

 

· Ingenuity in Network developments have taught that whatever pays something in return   is fun   or annoys someone (including its own author!) will be attempted

 

The VGNs of the InterPLUS

 

A motivation of the internet project is to allow new networking technology to be introduced while remaining functionally compatible   This allows for the phased introduction of new virtual networks without requiring a global change   Now is the time of the end of the status-quo and to implement Vint Cerf s second motivation in starting the internet project (cf   IEN 48   1978)   It is time to multiply ICANNs and to use the Internet as the neutral and transparent support to a presentation layer on the user side (PLUS) fringe to fringe myriad of Multi-Stakeholder s private   trade   local   regional   national virtual global networks (VGNs)   each of them with its own VGNIC meta-data referential system (MDRS) and HomeRoot   

 

Multistakeholderism will this way be embodied as the intergovernance of the enhanced cooperation of international   public   private and personal virtual global network managers 

Is certain kind of multistakeholderism a post-democratic ideology 

Need to save NetMundial outcome documents from crossing some sacred democratic lines

 

We have a lot of of positive expectation from the NetMundial meeting   As a part of the newly formed Just Net Coalition   IT for Change had earlier submitted a statement of principles as well a roadmap to democraticize global governance of the Internet   We hope that this meeting will be a major milestone in the path of forming a global consensus on how to govern the Internet in global public interest 

 

Meanwhile   this present contribution focuses on   what can be considered   a negative issue   We find a large number of submissions proposing   in one form or the other   some kind of  equal role for all stakeholders  in public policy decision making   Public policy making is a specific kind of political function that can only be undertaken by formally constituted political authorities   who draw their legitimacy from the people through clearly laid out political processes   Subversion of this arrangement through suggestions that various self-selected people and groups   including   prominently   the big business   should be able to exercise a formal political role in public policy making is a huge step back with regard to long-cherished democratic traditions   which are a hard won achievement after centuries of struggles and sacrifices 

 

Multistakeholder participation as expanding the consultative base of public policy making   and providing the much needed diverse expertise for it   is an immense positive development for deepening democracy   However   claims to formal  equal roles for all stakeholders  in decision making processes in this regard is grossly anti-democratic   and need to be pushed back 

 

The principles to be adopted by the NetMundial meeting should come up with a clear affirmation that actual decision making in terms of public policies remains the prerogative of people s representatives   however imperfect and evolving the systems of representation may be at present   At the national levels   public policies are to be developed by democratically elected governments   At the global level   it is a more complex pattern of country government representatives together making global policies which are either enforced directly through international mechanisms   or through harmonisation of national level public policies   While these systems of representation need to be consistently improved   to bring in self-selected groups   even more so   representatives of big business   into formal political roles of decision making   is to reverse the evolution of democracy 

 

It is important to improve participation of non-government actors in global public policy making   including through formal processes   The UN Internet Governance Forum is an excellent innovation in this direction   The distinction between participation of non- government actors in development of public policies   on one hand   and taking up a formal role in policy decisions   on the other   however   needs to be zealously maintained as a sacred line between democracy and a certain kind of post-democratic hubris 

 

Some other proposals   while stopping short of a formal role for non-government actors in public policy decision making   suggest mechanisms whereby non- government actors   including big business   get a formal veto in terms of which issues may be taken up for public policy development   and which not   Such mechanisms are also obviously highly undemocratic   and cannot be allowed   They favor status quo of existing power structures in global Internet governance   which goes against the interests of the less powerful sections and groups 

 

Whether in stating principles for Internet governance or suggesting a roadmap for democratizing global governance of the Internet   it must be ensured at the NetMundial meeting   that;

 

    There is no mention of any kind of equal role of all stakeholders in terms of public policy making   and 

    No group of actors - whether it is the big business   a set of technical institutions   or even a self-selected group of civil society persons/ organizations - is given a veto over what issues may be taken up for public policy development and by whom 

 

If democracy is to be saved   these should be the clear red lines for NetMundial outcome documents   We are laying such strong emphasis on this point because we suspect that it is the main objective of some groups to get some text into the outcome documents that crosses these sacred democratic lines   Some of these groups have already shown an exceptionally strong and deep strategic intent in this direction 

 

Lastly; we have no doubt that there are many kinds of technical level functions that may in fact need to be protected from ad hoc political interferences   The roles of different stakeholders will therefore be different for such delegated functions as against higher public policy functions   Here   the concept of equality of different stakeholders has a very different context and meaning   Many models based on such formal equality of stakeholders have been working well in technical and operational areas   and should be supported and encouraged   However   even these functions need political oversight as per clearly laid out public policy principles 

A Collaboratively Developed Set of Principles for Internet Governance   8 March 2014

 

PREAMBLE

The Internet provides an open   decentralised platform for communication   collaboration   innovation   creativity   and economic   cultural   social and political expression and development   It is an enabler of human rights   and can contribute to a more peaceful and world and greater social equality 

 

This document is an edited compilation of principles contained in the following documents   many which have been submitted independently to NetMundial   It was developed by a small group of individuals have been active in Internet governance processes for many years 

The documents referred to include statements of principles for Internet governance or policy-making from the following networks and institutions 

 

Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD)

Council of Europe (CoE)

Association for Progressive Communications (APC)

Internet Rights and Principles Coalition (IRPC)

Internet Society (ISOC)

United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE)

“Necessary and Proportionate” - International Principles on the Application of Human Rights to Communications Surveillance

The Brazilian Internet Steering Group (CGI BR)

Global Network Initiative (GNI)

 

1   FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES THAT SHOULD UNDERPIN INTERNET GOVERNANCE

 

Human rights and the rule of law

The governance of the Internet must be based upon   guided by and respectful of  human rights   and particularly freedom of expression   association and the right to privacy supported by the rule of law   The Internet must remain open and inclusive so that users may benefit from all that it offers 

Resilience and interoperability

The Internet must remain resilient and interoperable   underpinned by international standards and associated technical measures developed in open and inclusive processes

Diversity

The Internet is an open and inclusive medium that must respect and promote diversity in all its forms 

A global resource

The Internet must remain an un-fragmented   scalable and accessible global medium for the benefit of all 

 

2   PRINCIPLES FOR PROCESSES AND PARTICIPATION IN THE GOVERNANCE OF THE INTERNET

Transparency and accountability

Decision-shaping and decision-making in Internet governance should be open   comprehensible and accountable 

Openness

Internet governance processes should be open to interested parties   accessible to all including those not present in person and should welcome and encourage participation from around the globe 

Inclusive participation

Internet governance should be undertaken on a multi-stakeholder basis   enabling the full and equal participation of all stakeholders 

Collaboration and cooperation

Internet governance should be based on and encourage collaborative and cooperative approaches to policy development that reflect the inputs and interests of stakeholders 

Empowerment of users

Internet governance should have as a core driver the goal of enabling users around the globe to realize their human rights and to access the Internet to realize their social and economic potential 

Distributed governance

The Internet s global reach is best served by governance characterized by decentralized and multi-stakeholder mechanisms and organizations 

Global Geneva s Contribution to
NetMundial Section 2 
Roadmap for further Evolution
of the Internet Governance Ecosystem
By Jean-Christophe NOTHIAS   editor   and chief strategist at Global
Geneva 
Global Geneva is a Swiss non profit   based and registered in
Geneva since 2011   As a think-tank   it dedicates most of its efforts
observing and thinking beyond international relations   what are
‘global politics    and transnational and global governance   Global
Geneva is a member of the Coalition for a Just and Equitable
Internet   and a signatory of the Just Net Coalition contribution to
the Sao Paulo Conference (April 2014) related to Internet
Governance Principles   Will this contribution be known as the
JustNet Principles   as we discovered the NetMundial Principles
edited by 1Net   a new born grouping launched by ICANN in 2013
and partner of the conference  Having already NetMundial
Principles even before NetMundial has happened is somehow
puzzling   Let us assume that the excitement of entering this
fascinating debate was too high   Reading this contribution by
Global Geneva   one must keep in mind the Just Net Coalition
Principles 
Abstract
The future of Internet governance cannot be assimilated to the future of
ICANN   This contribution offers a fresh and thought provocative vision of a
complete new grand design   Without minimizing the importance of technical
functions such as IANA   the contribution takes a look at Internet Governance
through a more constitutional and universal” perspective   By proposing a 2-
entity eco-system in order to protect an Internet universal Charter (principles) 
and turn it into reality   this contribution is trying to bring innovation and
disruptive thinking   This contribution starts with a double assumption   It looks
at Multistakeholderism and its critic   If it is a smart tool to foster dialogue 
invented by business schools to serve corporations facing social and policy
issues   it cannot deal effectively with public policy making and social justice 
Only Democratic values   principles and processes can deliver a sustainable
governance for the Internet at a national and global level 
The Next Best Stage
for the future of Internet Governance
Is Democracy
If ‘multistakeholderism    initiated and applied by corporate managers and
consultants in the eighties and later developed by entities like Pr   Klaus
Schwab s WEF   is an interesting methodology born in US business schools[1]
to foster dialogue[2] among interested parties”   over many complex issues 
Democracy and its fundamental values   principles and mechanisms are still
our best bet to ensure an Internet fair and sustainable international
governance for the common and global good   Only to that double acceptation
will it be a road ahead for a just   safe   open and distributive Internet   The
challenge is not about opposing constantly the intergovernmental
multilateralism to a so-called multistakeholder model the challenge is
obviously to establish a governance that will primarily have in mind all
citizens   and all the users who pay their access to the Internet   The benefits to
shareholders/stakeholders are important   but we need to change our angle of
vision   and to have in our long view common values that will address a more
global understanding of why and how the Internet can benefit to all in a social
justice framework   and not just a for profit logic   in respect of Democratic
process and principles   still making the Internet technically robust   diverse
and operational   It is a difficult task   but the world has dealt successfully with
challenge of greater magnitude   As the tenants of the current eco-system are
simply trying to make a 2 0   or 3 0 Internet governance software with old and
dated   sometimes vague concepts   we believe that time has come for a fresh
thinking 
The editors of this contribution being French citizens   the way this submission
is conceived is necessarily molded out of their origins and culture   We
apologize for that   It is therefore neither an anglo-saxon thinking nor dress-up 
and the author apologized for twisting any reader s mind due to this franc and
opinionated élan   This submission was made out of any concern to collect
“+1” or self approval by partisans   to accommodate any grouping or factions 
and with no desire to please or not to please any entity or authority   It is a
contribution to the debate   Not a campaigning initiative   After a Wrong Turn
in the Internet Governance” in the late nineties as described   by Pr   Milton
Mueller   it is today a great challenge for all citizens and honest politicians to
be back thoughtfully in Internet Governance   A technical approach (“make it
work   document it later or a business approach (multistakeholderism) is not
what governance is about   Today Internet is fully related to politics   This is
good news for politics   as this future Internet governance will influence the
making of better global politics 
The author s choice was not to address a specific ICANN/IANA issue   which is a
serious but rather small part of the current challenge   The conference 
organized by Brazil and ICANN   is about the future of Internet Governance” 
not the future of ICANN itself   A ‘big picture  approach seemed to be
appropriate to deliver a more universal and balanced proposition   A grand
design is sometimes a good way to assess the entire scope of concern   and 
indeed   it has often delivered better lasting solution   Reforming the League of
Nations was a much too difficult task – what can be done when an American
president launched an idea that his US Congress refused to ratify  In that a
very complex case   creating a full new entity   with a grand design wit   was a
much greater success   and ultimately has kept until now warmongers mostly
deprived of their globalizing dark temptation 
1_Critics to the current state of Internet
governance
Internet governance is transiting a difficult time   and there is now an
unavoidable necessity for Democracies to stand for their citizen rights   wellbeing
and prosperity 
The global critic to the current state of Internet system of governance   which
is largely characterized as asymmetric”   has roots into a few major concerns
such as 
_1 1  When it comes to governance   the ‘multiskateholder  model has proved
that it does not exist   Everyone can enjoy and understand what a MS
approach is   which can be assimilated to a process convening or selfconvening
as many stakeholders   if not all   to engage an open and respectful
dialogue   But this qualification doesn t make a ‘model    and does certainly not
bring new systemic concepts within the corpus of political science   even
though some stakeholders can t help but putting this terminology in every
sentence   and at every corner and crossroad when passing over some
difficulty to convince others about their view on Internet governance   To this
day   there is no known or agreed definition by political science or law
academics over a so-called multistakeholder model when it comes to public
policy making   This terminology is over-played by people who pretend
Internet governance owes everything to multistakeholderism   which
appearance is often dated in 2004   Therefore critics are legitimate to
challenge conceptually   ideologically   historically and politically
multistakeholderism as THE core principle to rule over Internet governance 
_1 2  The need for the technical community that keeps inventing the Internet
is to be able to work   not through command   but by code consensus   Only
when the result and reality show resilience   comes time to document these
efforts   This methodology has certainly defined part of the cultural behavior of
the tech communities   as in the meantime prevented innovation and
disruption in the governance of the Internet   Can anyone test treaties 
regulation before documenting it  That would be really innovative and
disruptive but he cost for such testing would probably be politically and
socially unbearable   This successful techie approach is not appropriate to
establish a sustainable governance   Still   this is what happened when it comes
to understand the so-called multistakeholder model   It became documented
afterward by the tenants of the Internet s system of governance   It is not
difficult to understand why a post-justification became a high priority as the
Internet governance was coming under scrutiny by civil society and
governments   Discussion papers edited in 2011   in partnership with Google –
the editor is currently an ICANN board member- came very late to justify and
explain why the system was the way it was i e   ‘multistakeholder    Amusingly 
the paper identifies a former UN Secretary General as the ‘one  who inspired
the multistakeholder model back in 2004   It would be worth asking the
renowned Ghanaian diplomat his views on this did he though of a model of
governance   or did he simply convene stakeholders in order to have
governments back in the discussion  Most of all content published regarding
multistakeholderism is directly linked to neo-liberal organization such as the
WEF   or to partisans of the current system of governance of the Internet 
Neutral and independent academics work is still to be conducted to establish
the fundaments and reality of that model of governance 
_1 3  The need for the Siren Servers” - as Jaron Lanier labels them - to
maintain their constant growing benefits   technical supremacy and expertise
at all level   would it be architecture   software   infrastructure   encryption   IP
development   rooting   marketing services   advertising services   lobbying 
metadata mining   monetization   is also a challenge to any alternative
thinking   What works for the Siren Servers” is often what the big players
impose to smaller players or simple users to preserve competitive advance
and advantage   and their monopolistic position 
_1 4  The unachieved objective set by the Tunis agenda to re-embed”
governments in the system of governance of the Internet at a global level 
and not just over their respective national law space   when it comes to public
policy making (infrastructure development   transnational agreements and
liberalization   social benefits and empowerment   social justice to all citizens 
collecting due tax   regulating unfair competition   avoiding concentration and
abuse   protection of rights and laws) is a source of tension at the international
level   The Tunis agenda has called for each stakeholder role to be recognized 
including civil society and users   With already 10 years gone with the wind 
the UN WSIS process has to either die or come to rebirth   With the strong
opposition of the current tenants of the internet economic system   the
narrative has gone out of control   characterizing the UN or governments as a
danger   a risk or a threat to the so-called ungoverned   ungovernable
Internet   It is hardly conceivable that governments   in particular those of
Democratic extraction   or the UN are to be considered as negative forces
ready to refrain or destroy the Internet wonder   Refusing to consider the
potential dangers of cyber-crime and cyber-war would be irresponsible as
well   All of that is fueling critics against the current system of governance   if
one might call it a system 
_1 5  Today s asymmetric governance in the Internet space is also amplified
by the difficulty of a majority of citizens in the world with no   limited or
expensive access to the Internet to be heard   or only through the channel of
civil society entities   having themselves limited funds to bring their case and
cause to the general acknowledgement   and therefore raising more and more
voices from that corner of the world   In addition to that   most of the main
stream media are so far no following seriously the Internet governance issue
and debate   leaving it to a small group of usual suspects 
_ 1 6  Mass surveillance   in particular by one major democratic country   also a
leading force in the field of Internet technology   and online and offline
services   shocked many global citizens and their representatives over the
planet   bringing many to question the sincerity of a government that
champions Freedom of expression   flagging it as a constant inspiration to
conduct its international policy making   and obviously consistent with the
defense of its legitimate interest   But as Internet belongs and participates to
the creation of global politics   such a pro-domo behavior looks rather selfish 
on top of full infringement of citizen rights 
_ 1 7  Funding of investment to support infrastructure development and
digital empowerment around the world is a constant source of conflict
between most non US telecom operators and their US counterparts   digital
service providers   and US authorities   This is adding to the asymmetry
condemned by many   It is also obvious that the infrastructure gap is of high
concern in terms of justice between developed and developing countries 
_ 1 8  Multistakeholderism could help each participant to come to a better
understanding   Reality is that this mehtodology has now driven the Internet
Governance debate in a dead end   polarizing parties and not being able to
define a common language   Many supporters of the Multistakeholder
approach have opposed the creation of common definitions   although a very
necessary step to have any fruitful dialogue 
It is fair to salute all of those who made the Internet what it is today   Still
Internet cannot prosper and impact societies any further without facing a
crisis   if the global community of users   players and policy makers does not
recognized that Internet governance is not anymore a simple technical
challenge allowing both business to prosper   and military and police forces to
act under their respective governmental will with no respect to global citizens
rights and treaties of mutual cooperation and peace between nations   It would
not even be fair to respond to President Rousseff call in front of all nations   in
September 2013   by focusing a Brazilian multistakeholder meeting about
Internet Governance   over the single issue of an internationalization of ICANN
and IANA   ICANN is himself a co-organizer of that meeting   according to its
own website indications   To ask ICANN to reset by itself its own relation to the
US government and to IANA function– indeed a critical issue to all encryption
certifications (data-mining of algorithmic keys)- would be more or less like
asking the US to think for the US how to best reset the US asymmetric role 
For 10 years this option brought no result 
Due to the magnitude of its transformative ability to change our societies in
all of its aspects   we have to recognize that the Internet has now to face its
political endeavor   its global commons aspects and its obligation to rely on
various public policy arrangements   in the name of public interest   as global
and as consensual could they be   Internet has definitely step a foot into the
world of Global Commons   as it brings social justice challenges at the forefront
of a globalized world   This implies a coordinated effort at a public policy and
political level in a true democratic fashion   in order to deliver sustainable
benefits to all citizens   protecting their rights   and still making sure that
technological innovation keeps flooding the interconnectivity of more
networks   more root zones and more citizens   It cannot be accepted that in
terms of public policy making   the equal footing” championed by the
multistakeholder approach could imply that the voice of a state equates the
voice of a corporation   be it a successful one making billion of profits - larger
than the GDP of that many states - without paying its due tax to the
communities that contribute to the private benefit of a its shareholders 
The asymmetric governance of the Internet cannot survive in its current form 
Global Geneva s contribution is opting for a full new grand design that will
allow Internet principles to be fully understood and implemented   and not just
adapted to an evolution of what is currently the limited and asymmetric form
of the Internet governance eco-system   New thinking is the key word   Let s be
innovative and disruptive 
2_A new system of governance for the
Internet
We are of the opinion that there are three levels of understanding to further
articulate the next system of governance related to the Internet   and its many
issues and challenges 
- A intergovernmental level   (binding agreements   national and
international public regulation   international law)
- B global citizens level   (Internet principles   consensus   best
practices   empowerment   fair competition   innovation   capacity building)
- C arbitrage and justice level (unlocking deadlocks   dispute
settlement and court decision) 
_2 1  Intergovernmental level
Establishment of a World Internet Organization (WIO) able to legitimize
common public policies   regulations and standards related to interconnectivity
issues   Some of them could be of ‘soft power  essence – commonly accepted
but recognized by treaties -   some of ‘hard power  – new regulations or new
policies   WIO would have full legitimacy   with the largest constituency among
States   their signatures duly apposed to each other   WIO would be part   and
contributive to   the international law and policy making framework   Each
opportunity to vote by WIO constituency (governments) could be vetoed once 
and only once   by the WIF (see below)   In the latter case   a new round of
discussions and negotiations should take place 
The WIO executive board would have a mandate to bring initiative and
suggest reforms for approval and implementation by its constituencies   and
would have to forward   document and submit any suggestion approved by the
WIF (see below) on both the Internet public policy level   WIO bylaws or
Internet governance level   To enter the Internet governance law framework 
all of these suggestions would be approved by the WIO constituency   with a
75% majority   if not vetoed by the WIF (see below)   or after a second round of
negotiations within WIO   if primarily vetoed   WIO would not enter daily
operations of the Internet governance   Still it would be the referring authority
to IANA   due to its role with regard to DNS/root zone management   encryption
and IPs   It cannot be that an entity responsible for such critical functions could
be regulated   or place under an authority supposed to be regulated or having
just a technical perspective; putting IANA under the control of TLD registries
and root servers operators sounds even more dangerous   IANA functions
would be handled in a independent fashion 
Thinking of innovation   would it be more than one root zone   the WIF   and not
WIO   would create a board to oversight their setting   ruling   and interconnectivity
in full transparency and independence   Once set   this board
would be handled and managed with the same precaution as for IANA   under
WIO authority but not under its direct handling   The check and balance would
still be into the WIF s hands 
WIO would be the right entity to handle tax avoidance issues 
_2 2 Global citizens level
Establishment of a World Internet Forum (WIF) able to defend values 
(see Internet Charter or Internet Principles)   public concerns and support a
just   capable and thriving interconnected space   The WIF would be the venue
for a permanent dialogue between global citizens and all players in the field
starting with accredited civil society representatives   The WIF would suggest
and promote ideas   programs   policies (to WIO and governments)   working in
close relation with the other UN entities from Human Rights to Climate
Change   Environment   Development   Trade   Intellectual Property to fund and
support approved initiatives by the WIF   The WIF would be the ‘natural  entity
able to deliver empowerment and capacity building to any stakeholder   in
particular to public authorities and public servants expressing such a need 
The WIF would also be able to update the Charter if needed 
ICANN would be able to pursue its role for collective service fees   edit new
TLDs   under the supervision of the WIF   I would not handle global public policy
matters 
Regulatory proposal to WIO or initiative driven by grouping international
entities (public private partnership   public or private) should be endorsed by a
75% majority of the forum constituencies   No unanimity would be required   No
veto would be allowed to one single governments – no Security council here!
The dialogue within the forum would be of multistakeholder essence   but
profit-oriented participants would be excluded from voting with respect to
regulatory proposal to WIO and changes to the Internet Charter – no doubt 
the for profit participants would keep their capacity to express their view 
thanks to their powerful means 
The exact setting of the WIF constituency would be discussed thoroughly
during the preparatory period (see roadmap) 
The WIF would be part of the UN system   but its constituencies would not be
governments (see WIO)   but global citizens and civil society recognized
players of the field   All continents should be equally represented 
When values would be at stake   the WIF would address an official request to
the entity   government or stakeholder responsible for not respecting the
Internet Charter   This could lead to a resolution by the UN   and possible
sanctions 
The location of IANA at WIO   and ICANN at the WIF   have probably to do with
the fact that ICANN should be assimilated to a domain development and
service entity when it comes to domain name   IANA would be the technical 
safety and security entity   IANA should have a special link/status/contract with
WIO in order to avoid un-wanted interferences from governments   A 75%
majority at WIO would be requested to act/modify/contest a IANA decision 
making it difficult for governments to go beyond reasonable and consensual
demands   Again the WIF could veto a potential decision by WIO   once 
Among the WIF constituencies   there should be room for an online/remote
participation of global users and global citizens   A citizen initiative should be
considered   if able to embrace 5 continents   and criteria to be define during
the preparatory process (see roadmap) in order to suggest program or
regulation at the WIF level   then possibly at WIO level   The preparatory work
(see roadmap) should take this into account   so that for the very first time
citizens would have a chance to voice directly their concern   The digital
wonder of today allows the lawmakers to think of this democratic and
inclusive process to be part of the new Internet Governance eco-system   Such
an initiative could not be vetoed and the WIF would have to finalize a
proposal/initiative 
_2 3 Arbitrage and justice level to address deadlocks and disputes 
Establishment of a double system of arbitrage/settlement and
justice/constraint   taking into account the positive lessons from WTO and
WIPO   The arbitrage operandi would be placed under WIF scrutiny   in a
transparent   accountable and responsible fashion   If no arbitrage/settlement
could be concluded at the WIF by a specific board   the case would be brought
to the appreciation of the court of justice   seated at WIO 
The WIF board of settlement could be called in on issues/conflict related to
actions by stakeholders 
Action against the WIF could be taken to WIO 
As the UN system offers many different models of governance – see ILO   WTO 
ISO   WIPO   UNDP   UNEP… - it offers a lot of opportunity to adapt any
governance to the specifics of any major field of concerns   The UN system is
flexible enough to envision a new system of governance   taking the lessons of
other systems of governance   and considering the specifics of the Internet 
The UN system can bring legitimacy to new entities or mandates   having to
combine both international binding agreements and treaties with efficiency
and a required speed to cop with the extension of the Internet space   impact
and outcomes 
3_An innovation in international
governance of the Internet could impact
many other field of interests 
Since 1945   after a year of preparation and 4 months of intensive discussions
in San Francisco   the UN Charter was signed by 50 future member states on
June 26   the UN being installed on October 24   the same year   A fascinating
new governance product of the largest war ever   the second world war   a
globalized one   As an innovative political space   the UN even though it has
been often criticized has face many new challenges and ‘invented  many
innovative entities and programs   related to both immediate and long term
issues   One major innovation within the Internet new system of governance
would be the fact that WIO and WIF would both have strong capacities to act 
but would also be linked through a check and balance relation   As the WIF
would be the guardian” of a charter/framework of the Internet principles   it
would be legitimate to censor an agreement at WIO level   which would not be
in agreement with the Internet charter   A WIF veto would oblige any such
agreement at WIO level to go through one additional round of negotiations 
One possible option would be having the WIF as a member of WIO   the only
one with no voting rights   but a veto rights on first round   A second
negotiation would have to be conducted   in a fair understanding that the
same proposal could not be run again without some serious amendments   An
opposition between the WIF and WIO would lead to a major crisis which makes
this new system of governance interesting if citizens and leaders wish to keep
it aloft 
Any dispute against WIO should be taken to the UN general secretariat 
4_Funding of the new system of
governance for the Internet
4_1 WIO would be funded by its constituencies 
4_2 The WIF would be funded for its most part by service charges for Internet
unique identifiers (domain naming – extension) collected globally by ICANN 
and in addition   specifically by ISOC/PIR for  net    org    com    ngo      That
supposed that the ISOC/PIR capacities would be transferred to the WIF   ISOC
being a community based organization would   like any other civil society
organization   have to fund itself within its membership   or any other
appropriate system   The PIR expertise and staff could be incorporated as a
WIF department   but at reasonable cost   Such a funding for the WIF would be
more or less similar to the way WIPO is getting the majority of its funding 
4_3 The work over Internet Charter would be secure by the UN 
It seems consistent to think that the WIF will require more budget support
than WIO   which needs a secretariat but a rather small staff 
5_Roadmap for implementing the new
system of governance for the Internet
Democracies and members of the United Nations are now facing the major
challenges   As NetMundial will come to a conclusion on April 26   2014   the
Brazilian government should call for the UN to launch the following process 
and suggest to help and participate in the preparation and Sao Paolo followups
with a few other major governmental partners (Germany   France   Saudi
Arabia   India   China   South Africa and the US)   In 1944 and 1945   4 countries
prepared the draft of a UN Charter (China   United Kingdom   the Soviet Union
and the United States) after representatives of 26 countries pledged their
Governments to continue fighting together the Axis Powers on January 1st 
1942   when the term ‘United Nations  was first used by Franklin D   Roosevelt 
Such a call to the United Nations   following Brazilian president speech in front
of the UN General Assembly and the Sao Paulo meeting would show obvious
and strong consistency at both local and international level by the Brazilian
head of State following the Brazilian conference   The call would require to 
_5 1  Set a process to finalize an Internet Charter” by convening civil society 
users and their representatives   the technical and researching community 
and governmental and UN delegations in limited number   Many interesting
contribution are already there to start with   including the Just Net Coalition
Principles   No corporations or business associations should directly participate
to establishing that Charter - they already have enough power to voice their
views and try to influence the writers of such an Internet Charter 
_5 2  Set a common process to precisely define the two new bodies (WIO &
WIF)   their linkage   including check and balance between them   transparency
and accountability   and their common adequate roadmap   The US will have to
accommodate these requests   in order to end the asymmetric governance
and market dominance of the Internet   This will take away the risks that the
Internet is facing today   A non digital war treaty ratification should be a
natural complementary objective to that process through the WCIT/ITRs
channel   A Cyber war non proliferation treaty would be welcome 
_5 3 - Set a technical advisory group to best assess the core functions of the
Internet   and see how to adequately transform them   or not   and how and
where to position them in the framework of a WIO –WIF system   This process
would be supported by a neutral group of engineers able to assist and advice
the first two process in their reflection and capacities at a technical level 
Clear criteria are needed to select the participants 
_5 4 – Such a global project needs leadership   under the neutral oversight
and arbitrage of the UN general secretariat   A special appointment is
necessary to have a high level diplomat or a former foreign affair minister   a
former prime minister   or a personality of undisputable command   a
man/woman of high reputation able to handle that process with the support of
a small group of special assistants   He/she would have the support of a small
multistakeholder advisory board to help him/her cope with the spirit of the
overall process (WIF_WIO) and philosophy 
It seems reasonable to think that 5 1   5 2   5 3   5 4 could be achieved over a 1-
year time frame   paving the way to another 6 months to found   fund and
constitute the proposed entities and system of arbitrage and justice   and do
the switch from the old system   Until then   the current system would basically
be stable
