1  Why a concept of  Internet Universality  [1]

UNESCO has long recognized that the Internet has enormous potential to bring the world closer to peace  sustainable development and the eradication of poverty [2]As an international intergovernmental organization that operates with a global remit and promotes values that are universal  UNESCO has a logical connection to the Internet s  universality   This  universality  can be understood as the common thread that runs through four key social dimensions pertaining to the Internet  namely the extent to which this facility is based on universal norms of being  (i) Human Rights-based (and therefore free); (ii) Open; (iii) Accessible to All; and (iv) Multi-stakeholder Participation  The four norms can be summarized by the mnemonic R – O – A – M (Rights  Openness  Accessibility  Multi-stakeholder) 

 

Various stakeholders have characterized the Internet according to what they perceive as its essential features  highlighting one or other aspects such as freedom of expression  open architecture  security issues  online ethics  etc [3] What this range of conceptualizations illustrates is both the diversity of concerns and interests  as well as the multi-faceted character of the Internet itself   In turn  this prompts the question as to the possibility of understanding how the various considerations and dimensions relate to each other and to the wider whole  As a method to conceptualize this bigger picture  UNESCO is now canvassing the concept of  Internet Universality   which could serve as a macro-concept  The purpose is tocapture the enduring essentials of the vast  complex and evolving Internet  and which facilitates a comprehensive understanding of where and how different parties  and especially UNESCO  relate to the Internet  The concept could particularly serve as an enabling perspective in the context of the increasing centrality of Internet to societies  and specifically the increasing  Internetization  of education  the sciences  culture and communication-information 

 

As well as identifying four distinctive principles and norms that have special interest to UNESCO  the concept of  Internet Universality  groups these under a single integrated heading in a way that affords recognition of their mutually reinforcing and interdependent character  Without such a comprehensive intellectual device  it would otherwise be hard to grasp interconnections amongst UNESCO s Internet-related work and how it contributes to Knowledge Societies and the Post-2015 Sustainable Development Agenda 

 

As regards UNESCO s involvement in global debates  the concept of  Internet Universality  can be considered for its potential as a unifying  consolidated and comprehensive framework   On the one hand  it highlights the freedom and human rights principles as shared by those existing notions such as  Internet freedom ; on the other hand  it also provides an umbrella to address the intertwined issues of access and use  as well as the matters of technical and economic openness  In addition  the concept also encompasses multi-stakeholder engagement as an integral component  In this inclusive way  the  Internet Universality  concept can therefore be a bridging and foresighted framework for dialogue between North and South and among different stakeholders  As such  it could also make a unique contribution to shaping global Internet governance discourse and the post-2015 Sustainable Development Agenda 

 

2  Unpacking the concept of  Internet Universality 

The linking of four normative components of the  universality  of the Internet builds closely upon prior UNESCO thinking about the Internet which includes 

- Recommendation on the Promotion and Use of Multilingualism and Universal Access to Cyberspace (2003) [4] (This document particularly points to the accessibility norm  as well as the need to balance rights) 

- Reflection and Analysis by UNESCO on the Internet (2011) [5] (This document highlights normative work in relation to UNESCO s programmes  and multi-stakeholder participation) 

- Final Recommendations of WSIS+10 review event  and the Final Statement of the WSIS+10 review event (2013) which was endorsed by UNESCO member states at their General Conference in 2013 [6] (These documents cover rights  access  openness  and multi-stakeholder issues) 

- UNGIS (UN Group on the Information Society) Joint Statement on the Post-2015 Sustainable Development Agenda (2013) [7] (This document highlights the importance of the social conditions for Information and Communication Technologies in general  and the Internet in particular  to contribute to inclusive Knowledge Societies) 

 

 Internet Universality  integrates a range of existing UNESCO insights and shows the link between the Internet and what UNESCO has already recognized[8] as the underlying key principles of Knowledge Societies  freedom of expression  quality education for all  universal access to information and knowledge  and respect for cultural and linguistic diversity  In this way  the concept highlights what is needed for the Internet to be a means towards achieving Knowledge Societies  It serves as a heuristic to highlight that the Internet s character and utility entail technical  social  legal  economic and other arrangements which in turn depend on particular norms that underpin the positive potentiality of this facility  Considered in more depth  the R – O – A – M norms constitutive of  Internet Universality  (Rights  Openness  Accessibility  Multi-stakeholder) can be understood as follows 

 

(i)            By identifying the Internet s connection to Human Rights-based norms as constituents of freedom   Internet Universality  helps to emphasize continued harmony between the growth and use of the Internet and human rights   A free Internet in this sense means one that respects and enables the freedom to exercise human rights [9] In this regard   Internet Universality  enjoins us to consider the gamut of interdependencies and inter-relationships between different human rights and the Internet – such as freedom of expression  privacy  cultural participation  gender equality  association  security  education  etc 

 

(ii)            Internet Universality  also highlights the norm of the Internet based on the principle of Openness  This designation recognizes the importance of technological issues such as open standards  as well as standards of open access to knowledge and information  Openness also signals the importance of ease of entry of actors and the absence of closure that might otherwise be imposed through monopolies 

 

(iii)          Accessible to All as a principle-based norm for  Internet Universality  raises issues of technical access and availability  as well as digital divides such as based on economic income and urban-rural inequalities  Thus it points to the importance of norms around universal access to minimum levels of connectivity infrastructure  At the same time   accessibility  requires engaging with social exclusions from the Internet based on factors such as literacy  language  class  gender  and disability  Further  understanding that people access the Internet as producers of content  code and applications  and not just as consumers of information and services  the issue of user competencies is part of the accessibility dimension of  Universality   This highlights UNESCO s notion of Media and Information Literacy which enhances accessibility by empowering Internet users to engage critically  competently and ethically 

 

(i)            The Internet in this sense cannot only be seen from the  supply side   but needs a complimentary  user-centric  perspective  The Participatory  and specifically the Multi-stakeholder engagement  dimension of  Internet Universality  facilitates sense-making of the roles that different agents (representing different sectors as well as different social and economic status  and not excluding women and girls) have played  and need to continue to play  in developing and governing the Internet on a range of levels   Participation is essential to the value that the facility can have for peace  sustainable development and poverty eradication   In bridging contesting stakeholder interests  participative mechanisms contribute to shared norms that mitigate abuses of the Internet   Universality  here highlights shared governance of the Internet 

 

These norms for these four aspects are distinct  but they also reinforce each other  Rights without accessibility would be limited to the few; accessibility without rights would stunt the potential of access  Openness allows for sharing and innovation  and it complements respect for rights and accessibility  Multi-stakeholder participation helps guarantee the other three norms  Overall  an Internet that falls short of respecting human rights  openness  accessibility or multi-stakeholder participation would by definition be far less than universal  

 

3  How the concept of  Internet Universality  is relevant to UNESCO

 

UNESCO has a unique role in promoting  Internet Universality   It is the UN agency with a mandate that spans social life at large and  within this  has programs that involve the Internet in education  culture  science  social sciences and communication-information   By using  Internet Universality  as an umbrella concept  UNESCO can position more specific concerns such as mobile learning  education for girls  cultural and linguistic diversity  media and information literacy  research into climate change  freedom of expression  universal access to information  bioethics and social inclusion  etc  In this way   Internet Universality  can also support the priorities of Gender Equality and Africa  It can serve as an over-arching  integrating framework for Internet-related work across UNESCO  establishing a common frame of reference for all  Operationally the concept can elevate a range of work to the status of initiatives that jointly advance  Internet Universality   It can encourage synergies and inter-sectoral co-operation and joint programming  In particular  the concept can enhance understanding of the mid-term strategy of 2014-2021 (37/C4) and the quadrennial program (37/C5) 

 

4  Conclusion

 

 Internet Universality  accords with the Organization s service to the wider international community in the following respects 

    Laboratory of ideas  including foresight – elaborating the concept is directly relevant to UNESCO s creative and think-tank potential;
    By stimulating global debate   Internet Universality  illustrates how UNESCO can be a catalyst for international cooperation  with a holistic and inclusive approach 
    Standard-setter – if the concept gained traction broadly  it could inform the development of standards for monitoring progress in  Internet Universality 
    As a normative framework that can inform policies  and draw in public and private  civil society and decision-makers   Internet Universality  can help UNESCO fulfill its role as a capacity-builder in Member States 

Looking ahead   Internet Universality  could follow in the footsteps of previous influential intellectual work by UNESCO such as the concepts of  Intangible cultural heritage  and  Knowledge Societies   Because  Internet Universality  represents an updated conceptualization of the era  the concept could become a valuable contribution to the global discussion about this complex and dynamic human creation and serve to enhance Internet s continued contribution to humanity s shared future

Overview

 

Any plan to transfer Stewardship of IANA over to another entity should be preceded by extensive consultations with all stakeholders   This is one plan  among others  that should be discussed over the course of the May 2014 - May 2015 so that a consensus solution can be found prior to September 2015 when the current contract expires   It needs to be understood that any proposal for transition from the current IANA arrangements or US Government oversight would require a transition plan that was well formed  endorsed by stakeholders and the key customers of IANA services  in order to guarantee the security and stability of the Internet 

 
Principles of the roadmap

 

In defining a roadmap for IANA several principles should hold 

 

  Stability and security of the Internet should be the highest priority at all times 

 

  Completing the plan to bring IANA functions under ICANN as originally documented in the White Paper is an advisable and overdue milestone  but not the ultimate goal 

 

  Oversight of IANA should be a multistakeholder function

 

  No single stakeholder group should have sole oversight of IANA

 

  No single country should have a preeminent role in overseeing IANA

 

 

  As IANA s functions are limited to data maintenance  database provision and coordination -- whose methods are determined in IETF  ICANN and the RIRs -- IANA should not have a policy role  Each of these organization must retain the oversight of its own data and methods 

 

  Oversight of IANA will focus on performance  adherence to Service Level agreements and MOUs with the organizations with which it has signed MOUs (referred to as Partners elsewhere in this document)   These MOUs should be modeled on the current MOU between ICANN and the IETF  as described in RFC2860  RFC6220 and in subsequent updates to the MOU  with similar reporting requirements and appropriate service level agreements 

 

  Reporting requirements and service level agreements between IANA and its partners should be negotiated and executed in a public and transparent way; ensuring that all affected stakeholders are involved in the development of those requirements 

 
Scope of the IANA Operations Function

 

Under this proposal  IANA s Operations Scope would be limited to four major activities 

 

  global apex of Internet numbering resources (for example IPv4  IPv6 addresses  AS numbers  etc );

 

  global apex of Internet DNS-based naming resources (including the root zone of the public  global DNS  management of the  arpa and  int top-level namespaces  and IDN practices)

 

  management of Internet protocol parameters as required from the IETF

 

  maintenance of the Internet s time zone database

 

The intent of this proposal is insure that the scope of the current IANA Operations Function is not changed or added to during the transition to Stewardship by an independent IANA Stewardship Group (ISG)  Once the IANA was a fully independent organization it is intended that the functions listed above would be added to  changed or even moved to other organizations only through negotiation and consensus agreement between the IANA Stewardship Group and those organizations that are  Partners  of IANA (see below) 
Plan

In order to complete the White Paper Plan the US Government should first relinquish its oversight role to a new IANA Stewardship Group while the IANA Operational Activity temporarily remains executed by ICANN   The IANA Stewardship Group would be an independent group (see below) that provides strategic and planning direction for IANA s Operational Activity   This intermediate step would see the IANA Stewardship Group operate in much the same way as the Internet Architecture Board (IAB) operates under the Internet Society (ISOC) umbrella  an independent group where ICANN would be responsible for IANA Operational Activities but where the IANA Stewardship Group would be responsible for the strategic direction of IANA 

This would be done as an intermediate step before IANA is established as an independent entity    ICANN s limited  temporary stewardship of ICANN should be defined in MOUs between ICANN and the various Internet organizations that rely on IANA  such as IETF  and the RIRs (the partners) for a maximum of 3 years 

 

Immediately upon the transferring IANA to ICANN stewardship  the IANA Stewardship Group would be responsible for 

 

  Oversight of IANA function under the ICANN corporate umbrella according to the MOUs 

 

  Consultation with stakeholders on the structure and processes  including oversight  of a free standing IANA

 

  Within 3 years of the date of the transfer  establishing an independent IANA
 
IANA Stewardship Group

 

The IANA Stewardship Group is intended to reflect broad stakeholder input into the operations and strategic direction of the IANA Operational Activity during the interim period  The membership must reflect a globally diverse balance of the key stakeholders who use the work products of IANA   The IANA Stewardship Group should be organized composed of 

 

  1 Representative from each of ICANN supporting organizations

 

  Addressing Supporting Organization (ASO)

 

  Country Code Name supporting Organization (CCNSO)

  Civil society

 

  Private Sector

  Intergovernmental Organization
 
 
Eventual structure of independent IANA

 

The framework advised in this recommendation is that of an International Non Governmental Organization which has host country agreements with several countries that guarantee that IANA would be governed by its MOUs   It is recommended that the IANA data and functions be distributed in several countries that provide the greatest protections for an open  accessible and trusted Internet  The oversight mechanism for the independent IANA must be defined by the IANA Stewardship Group prior to the signing of MOUs with IANA Partners (see Milestones  below)   In addition to resolution of conflicts by internal processes there should be an appeals mechanism that relies on a trusted International Arbitration entity  The initial internal conflict resolution processes and appeals mechanism must be in place prior to the signing of MOUs with IANA Partners (see Milestones  below)  The structure and framework for IANA should  to the full extent possible  be transparent and accountable to those with whom it has signed MOUs

1  Introduction
By Resolution 52 of the 37th General Conference in 2013  UNESCO is mandated to conduct a
comprehensive and consultative study on Internet-related issues  the results of which should
inform the Organization s reporting to the 38th Conference in 2015  This resolution emerged
after debate by Member States following the tabling of a Discussion Paper at the 192nd General
Conference  as per mandate of the 192nd Executive Board 1 The Study will be intersectoral in
nature  drawing on Communication-Information  and Social and Human Sciences amongst other
parts of UNESCO  The ability of the UNESCO Secretariat to undertake the large-scale
consultation as required for this Study was shown in the February 2013 first review event of the
World Summit on the Information Society (WSIS) 
2  Context
As indicated in the Discussion Paper prepared for UNESCO s 37th General Conference  the
digital revolution is impacting on all spheres of public and private life  More and more personal
and public information is collected  stored  processed and shared via the Internet  All this brings
with it unparalleled opportunities as well as challenges  Cyberspace is especially complex and
sensitive  because of its transnational and multidimensional character  This calls for a holistic
approach to address the broad range of issues relating to its use  UNESCO as a universal
organization with a mandate relevant to many cyber issues can foster trust and dialogue  and
build consensus at the global  regional and national levels  An inclusive multi-stakeholder
process as mandated in 37 C/Resolution 52 can  through UNESCO  provide a platform for all
actors to examine complexities and propose well-informed options 
3  Background to the Study
A draft resolution tabled at UNESCO s 37th General Conference in November 2013 prompted
debate which indicated that besides reported instances of government monitoring of the
Internet  many other issues on the Internet emerged for discussion  including privacy more
broadly  as well as freedom of expression  access and ethics  There was general acceptance
that UNESCO was an appropriate forum to facilitate and have a leadership role in these issues 
The result was a consensus in the form of 37 C/Resolution 52  which affirmed the applicability of
human rights in cyberspace and mandated the Study which is the subject of this Concept Paper 
4  UNESCO s previous work of relevance to the Study
From the mid-1990s  UNESCO organized a series of international expert meetings that led to
the adoption by the General Conference of UNESCO in 2003 of the  Recommendation
concerning the Promotion and Use of Multilingualism and Universal Access to Cyberspace  
UNESCO s concept of Knowledge Societies – based on freedom of expression  universal
access to knowledge  quality education for all  and respect to cultural and linguistic diversity –
has been positively received by all stakeholders  The World Report on Knowledge Societies 
addressing all these issues  was published in 2005  In addition to the above  at the 36th General
Conference in 2011  Member States examined a document  Reflection and Analysis by
UNESCO on the Internet   Further  UNESCO s Intergovernmental Information for All
Programme developed the  IFAP Code of Ethics for the Information Society   Member States
took note of this and invited the Organization to suggest possible ways of addressing the ethical

Expression  Privacy and Ethical Dimensions of the Information Society  produced on mandate of
UNESCO Executive Board 192 EX/Decision 40 
dimensions of the information society  Subsequent consultations with Member States and other
stakeholders led to the document  UNESCO and the ethical dimensions of the information
society  which was endorsed by the Executive Board at its 190th session in 2012 2
Since 2003  UNESCO has been a significant actor in the World Summit on the Information
Society (WSIS)  and has worked systematically on the six Action Lines it is mandated to lead 3
Most recently  the 37th General Conference in 2013 endorsed the Final Statement of the
UNESCO-organized  first WSIS+10 Review Event  held at Headquarters in February 2013 
The documents produced in these processes  along with information gained from consultations
with stakeholders as elaborated below  are important input materials for the Study 
5  Process
As per C 37/Resolution 52  the modality of this Study is consultative  incorporating  an inclusive
multi-stakeholder process which includes governments  private sector  civil society  international
organizations and the technical community   As such  consultation will involve meetings with
UNESCO Member States  and thematic debates at the governing councils of the Information for
All Programme and the International Programme for the Development of Communication 
Another forum for consultation is UNESCO s World Commission for the Ethics of Science 
Technology and Knowledge (COMEST) 
Because the issues continue to be debated autonomously in other UN fora  the Study will
therefore monitor further developments there  Relevant here are meetings in 2014 of the ITU 
the Human Rights Council  and the UN General Assembly  Amongst other structures suited to
consultation  are the United Nations Group on the Information Society (UNGIS)  the Internet
Governance Forum and the WSIS Fora  the Broadband Commission for Digital Development 
and a range of new initiatives  Consultation will also be done through UNESCO participation in
various international conferences and fora  In addition  the various declarations and statements
by various stakeholders around the world will be analysed in order to inform the research 
The primary method of data collection is a qualitative research questionnaire  covering the four
fields of the Study (Access  Freedom of Expression  Privacy  Ethics) The questions therein are
informed by UNESCO s specific mandate and interests  particularly in terms of the principles of
human rights  openness  accessibility and multi-stakeholderism (as elaborated in section 6
below)  The responses will show the range of analyses and options on the issues at hand 
The above illustrates UNESCO s complementary and collaborative approach to others working
on Internet-related issues  More detail on the research process is given in separate documents 
2 UNESCO has also examined dimensions of online rights in two publications –  Freedom of Connection – Freedom
of Expression  The Changing Legal and Regulatory Ecology Shaping the Internet  (2011) and a  Global Survey on
Internet Privacy and Freedom of Expression  (2012) 
3 These Action Lines are   Access to information and knowledge  (C3)   E-learning  (C7)   E-science  (C7)   Cultural
diversity and identity  linguistic diversity and local content   (C8)   Media  (C9) and  Ethical dimensions of the
Information Society  (C10) 
6  Overview of the Comprehensive Study
As affirmed in the Discussion Paper prepared for UNESCO s 37th General Conference  the
Organization s approach to the Internet must be framed within its mandate  From those
documents already adopted by UNESCO governing bodies  four principles are especially
important in guiding the approach of the Organization to the Internet  They point to the
importance of an Internet for UNESCO that is rights-based  open  accessible and multistakeholder
participative (summarized in the acronym R O A M )  As befits UNESCO as a
universal organization  these principles are also the underpinnings for the universality of the
Internet  which in turn is a sine qua non for reaching Knowledge Societies 4 The stronger the
correspondence of the Internet to these four principles  the greater the universality and therefore
its potential to contribute to building Knowledge Societies 
UNESCO s cross-sectoral character is fundamental for the universality of the Internet  and the
R O A M principles encompass the Organization s work to advance universality in education 
social inclusion  multi-lingualism in cyberspace  access to information and knowledge  ethical
thinking and press freedom  amongst others  Also relevant for universality is Broadband
Commission for Digital Development which links Internet to accelerated progress towards the
Millennium Development Goals 
The universality framework underpins how UNESCO scopes the required fields of research
(Section 7 below) and informs the draft questions (see Appendix) 
7  Fields of Study  Access  Freedom of Expression  Privacy and Ethics 
7 1 Access to information and knowledge
Access to information and knowledge is a basic requirement for building inclusive knowledge
societies with strong foundations for lasting peace and sustainable development  There has
been a significant increase in access  but the digital divide continues to exclude large numbers
of people  particularly women and girls  and especially in Africa and LDCs  Considered in terms
of the framework outlined in section 6 above  the Study frames Access issues as follows 
Rights  Relevant from the UNESCO point of view is that access to information  as a precondition
for knowledge  is linked to Universal Declaration of Human Rights Article 19 which affirms that
4 Since February 2013  UNESCO has undertaken extensive consultations on using  Internet universality 
as an overarching term to designate the principles within the Organization s agreed positions on the
Internet  Commencing during the 2013 Review Event of the World Summit on the Information Society  the
consultations have continued through 10 other international events  as well as internally with all sectors of
the Organization  Summarizing four principles which are extant in accepted UNESCO texts on the
Internet  the notion of  Internet universality  provides a vision of a universalized Internet aligned with
UNESCO s mandate and values  It highlights the kind of Internet needed to achieve Knowledge Societies
in which information and knowledge are not simply issues of technological availability  but are integrally
bound up with the human aspects of development  See  www unesco org/internet-universality
the right to freedom of expression  includes the freedom to seek and receive information and
ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers   This applies online and offline 
Openness  For UNESCO  it is important that the Internet s ability to provide open access is
fostered  The UNESCO OER platform already provides access to more than 150 knowledge
resources developed by the Organization and its partners 
Accessibility  UNESCO s approach is that access to information alone is not a sufficient
requirement for the creation of Knowledge Societies  Access to knowledge entails learning in
formal and informal education settings  It also entails fostering the competencies of Media and
Information Literacy (MIL) so as to empower users to make full use of access to the Internet 
Enhancing the quality and linguistic diversity of content  developing sustainable digital heritage 
encouraging local content online  and promoting special services for marginalized groups are
also central to UNESCO s interests in accessibility  The Organization s support for journalism
education also contributes to the provision of quality information accessible in cyberspace 
Multi-stakeholder participation  Access to the Internet has grown over the decades as a result of
activities by numerous stakeholders  No single actor can ensure responsibility for deepening the
ubiquity of affordable high-speed Internet access across devices  platforms  services 
languages  content and user capacities  UNESCO s embrace of relations with National
Commissions  civil society and other actors highlights its intrinsic character of enabling broad
access to the Organization  including through UNESCO online Knowledge Communities 
7 2 Freedom of Expression
UNESCO s constitutional mandate to promote the  free exchange of ideas and knowledge  is
reinforced by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights which affirms that  everyone has the
right to freedom of opinion and expression   This right has also been protected in the
International Convention on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR)  and further elaborated in relation
to internet and mobile-based information dissemination systems by the UN Human Rights
Committee (July 2011)  in its General Comment No  34 on Article 19 of the ICCPR 5 Assessed
in terms of universality principles for the Internet  the following can be stated 
Rights  For UNESCO  the right to freedom of expression applies  as do other rights  to
cyberspace  and all persons should be safe to use this right  Accordingly  as the UN Human
Rights Committee Comment states  any limitation of freedom of expression online should be the
exception rather than norm  Further  the international standard requires that any restrictions
must be provided by law  may only be imposed for legitimate grounds as set out in the UDHR 
and must also conform to tests of necessity and proportionality  Restriction that exceeds these
standards in any one locality has a direct global significance for users on the Internet elsewhere 
UNESCO works worldwide to promote freedom of expression online and offline 
5 http //www2 ohchr org/english/bodies/hrc/comments htm
Openness  Freedom of expression online is linked to the principle of openness  particularly in
regard to the international standards that advocate transparency in relation to restrictions on the
right to expression  Open opportunities to share ideas and information on the Internet are
integral to UNESCO s positions on freedom of expression and inter-cultural dialogue 
Accessibility  For UNESCO  freedom of expression online is also a question of how people use
their access to express themselves on the Internet  Media and Information Literacy is relevant
to this question  particularly in regard to expression dealing with hatred and gender issues 
Multi-stakeholder participation  UNESCO sees freedom of expression as a matter in which each
individual has a stake  The Organization has long promoted self-regulation as the optimum
mechanism for promoting ethical and professional journalism; in regard to cyberspace it is also
evident that online media accountability entails self-regulatory systems and ethical principles
which in turn need participative involvement to secure legitimacy and be effective 
7 3 Privacy
The general right to privacy is related to many distinct issues  such as anonymity and dignity 
On the Internet  there are additional related issues  ranging from consumer data protection and
intellectual property to data-mining  and cyber-security  Privacy relates particularly to the
collection  storage  use and circulation of personal data 
Rights  UNESCO follows the UDHR that human rights are indivisible  recognizing thereby that
particular actions concerning the right to privacy can impact on other rights  such as the right to
freedom of expression  and vice versa  As noted in 37 C/Resolution 52   privacy is essential to
protect journalistic sources  which enable a society to benefit from investigative journalism  to
strengthen good governance and the rule of law  and that such privacy should not be subject to
arbitrary or unlawful interference   At the same time  as noted in the Discussion Paper prepared
for the 37th General Conference  privacy may also not be used to shield violations of individual
rights or to block the media from exposing these  Public interest must enter any calculation of
balancing rights  and Article 29 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights sets out this test
for the purpose and method required in regard to balancing   In the exercise of his rights and
freedoms  everyone shall be subject only to such limitations as are determined by law solely for
the purpose of securing due recognition and respect for the rights and freedoms of others and of
meeting the just requirements of morality  public order and the general welfare in a democratic
society  
Openness  Privacy articulates directly with transparency concerning the collection  storage and
analysis of personal data  It also relates to open source technology  which enables scrutiny of
privacy protection in the relevant software  UNESCO stands for an appropriate balance and
sufficient safeguards to ensure the public and individual interests in the interface between
privacy and openness 
Accessibility  Fundamental to users taking advantage of access to the Internet is whether they
can trust that their rights will be respected  Without confidence  users may begin to limit their
involvement  and the universality of the Internet will be diminished  At the same time  users
should themselves respect privacy on the Internet  and UNESCO s work in Media and
Information Literacy has a role to play here 
Multi-stakeholder participation  Given the complex ecology of the Internet  balancing privacy
with other rights in public interest lends itself to multi-stakeholder participation  especially in
regard to norms  issues of regulation and self-regulation 
7 4 Ethics
From UNESCO s perspective  the Internet should help advance respect for and realization of
human rights  Possible discrepancies between this vision and real-world situations raise issues
for ethical consideration   Ethics   in this context  can be understood as the simultaneous
affirmation of human rights  peace  equity  and justice  as well as a field of inquiry and style of
interrogation in and of itself  Alongside work conducted on the ethics of science and technology 
issues of social transformation relating to the uses and effects of digital technologies have also
been considered at an exploratory level within UNESCO s Management of Social
Transformations (MOST) programme  From the point of view of universality principles  the
following applies 
Rights  UNESCO places the debate on Internet within an ethical discourse that integrates
human rights into its general perspective  thus highlighting that the usage of technology is not
 value-free   Hence  the central concern remains how to develop the Internet in the service of
human rights  greater equity  and justice  by encouraging ethical sensitivity in regard to use of
the Internet  This entails promoting an engagement with the Internet that is thoughtful  informed
and which advances peace and the realization of each person s full potential  It is a matter of
actors using human rights for these objectives  of ethical self-regulatory systems such as
UNESCO promotes in the case of journalists  and of Media and Information Literacy 
Openness  ICTs are sometimes viewed as being neutral and  on this basis  value judgments
may only be made in relation to the intent  use and the outcomes  Another perspective argues
that ICTs are embedded  whether explicitly or implicitly in their design  with assumptions 
expectations  values and biases along with the viewpoints of their designers and the societies in
which they are created  Technologies embody particular choices with distinct consequences
that may explicitly or otherwise favour certain behaviors or inhibit the ability of some segments
of society to benefit from them  Ethical consideration is needed in regard to the extent to which
the Internet enables transparent and open technology standards and opportunities  and the
principle of openness in turn can facilitate users developing greater ethical awareness of ICTs 
Accessibility  ICTs are  resources  whose ethical usage and distribution create the conditions for
a greater well-being  They are also the building blocks of UNESCO s vision of inclusive
Knowledge Societies  In such societies  ICTs are seen  in fact  as ceasing to be simple
 affordances   but functioning as the grounds for shared global life  This is why Internet
accessibility issues such as gender  language  knowledge  culture and identity are profoundly
ethical  In addition  ethics are relevant within the perspective that perceives ICTs as factors in
drastic changes in the context of social interactions  such as removing important social cues
with potential impact that may be socially inappropriate  Media and Information Literacy which
includes ethical reasoning can empower Internet users to engage with these issues 
Multi-stakeholder participation  The different perspectives and assumptions about technology
and its relation to society highlight the need for increased awareness as well as critical
international  with particular attention to participation of developing countries and sensitivity to
their needs  and interdisciplinary consideration on the ethical dimensions of the information
society at all levels – by users  network operators  content producers  designers of ICT  and
policy-makers 
8  Conclusion
In the process of implementing this Study  UNESCO will be demonstrating its vitality and
relevance to key debates concerning the Internet  If extra-budgetary funds can be secured  the
Study could be strongly aided by an expert group and by a conference at UNESCO early in
2015 to discuss a draft synthesis of findings  Progress will be reported to the 196th Executive
Board in April 2015  The final outcomes of the process will  as required  be presented within the
report to the 38th General Conference in November 2015  within the framework of UNESCO s
follow-up to the World Summit on the Information Society 
Based on the Organization s consensus-building track record about Internet issues  and the
extensive consultation that is envisaged for the Study  UNESCO is well placed to foster a
common purpose amongst stakeholders about how the Internet can help us achieve the vision
of Knowledge Societies

Internet Rights & Principles
Coalition
1
The Internet Rights & Principles Dynamic Coalition is an international network of individuals and organizations working to uphold human rights in the online environment and across the spectrum of internet policy-making domains  It is based at the UN Internet Governance Forum  an open  multistakeholder  forum for government  business  and civil society groups to come together to discuss mutual points of concern that fall under the rubric of internet governance (http //www intgovforum org/cms) 
Since 2008  the IRP Coalition has been active in promoting rights-based principles for internet governance  at the global IGF as well as in regional meetings and related events  Individuals and organizations in the IRP Coalition come from all walks of life  It has participants from the Global South and Global North—grassroots groups  international NGOs  researchers  activists  lawyers  businesses  internet and mobile phone service providers  technical communities  government representatives  and intergovernmental organizations 
The main work of the Internet Rights and Principles Coalition (IRP Coalition) to date has been to translate existing human rights to the internet environment to build awareness  understanding and a shared platform for mobilisation around rights and principles for the internet 
Our flagship document  the Charter of Human Rights and Principles for the Internet (http //internetrightsandprinciples org/wpcharter) covers the whole gambit of human rights drawing on the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and other covenants that make up the International Bill of Human Rights at the United Nations (http //www ohchr org/EN/Issues/Pages/WhatareHumanRights aspx)  It is the outcome of work from many people and organisations over the years and is growing in stature as others start to apply its 23 clauses to specific situations  In 2011  the coalition launched the Ten Punchy Principles (http //internetrightsandprinciples org/site/campaign)  a distillation of ten key values and principles underlying the Charter  This booklet contains both these documents  At the UNESCO First WSIS +10 Review Meeting in early 2013 (https //www unesco-ci org/cmscore/events/51-rights-based-principles-and-internet-taking-stock-and-moving-forward)  the IRP Coalition set out on the second phase of the IRP Charter   Charter 2 0  
Introduction
 
The aim of the Charter 2 0 project is twofold 
1
To raise more awareness about the Charter in light of increasing public concern at the national and international levels about the protection and enjoyment of human rights online as well as offline 
2
To open up participation and input as we look to upgrade parts of the current Charter in order to underscore that the human rights and principles contained in this charter will provide a coherent and necessary framework for developing internet governance principles at the IGF and beyond 
2
What is the purpose of Charter of Human Rights & Principles for the Internet 
The goal of the IRP Charter is to provide a recognizable framework anchored in international human rights for upholding and advancing human rights for the online environment  This goal breaks down into three main objectives  To provide
1
a reference point for dialogue and cooperation between different stakeholder priorities for the internet s design  access  and use around the world 
2
an authoritative document that can frame policy decisions and emerging rights-based norms for the local  national  and global dimensions of internet governance 
3
a policy-making and advocacy tool for governments  businesses  and civil society groups committed to developing rights-based principles for the internet 
Who is the Charter of Human Rights & Principles for the Internet Addressing 
Human rights govern the relationship between the State and the individual  so human rights obligations bind states  The Charter is based on existing human rights and so in practice most of its provisions will only be binding on the State  However there is a growing recognition that the private sector does have obligations under human rights law  as authoritatively outlined in the UN  Protect  Respect and Remedy  Framework 
What do we mean by Human Rights & Principles 
Human rights are international human rights as defined by international law  We have translated these directly to the internet with provisions such as freedom from blocking and filtering  These can be identified by the use of language such as  everyone has a right to     and  everyone has a freedom to      By  Principles  we are talking about those internet policy principles or implementation principles that describe features of the system which are required to support human rights  these can be identified by the use of language such as  shall  and  must

How the IRP Charter Came About
5
The idea of translating human rights for governance of the internet emerged during the second phase of the World Summit on the Information Society and was widely endorsed at the Tunis Summit in 2005  Two coalitions formed at this time to undertake this task  The Internet Bill of Rights Dynamic Coalition set out to develop a Charter of Human Rights  and the Framework of Principles for the Internet Dynamic Coalition that set out to focus on internet governance principles 
By the third Internet Governance Forum meeting in 2008  held in Hyderabad (India)  a consensus had formed that these two projects  developing human rights and principles for the internet  are intimately related  certain principles must be upheld in order to sustain an online environment which supports human rights  In early 2009 these two coalitions merged to form the Internet Rights and Principles (IRP) Dynamic Coalition in order to combine their forces and resources within the  multistakeholder participatory model  that drives the IGF  The outcome of this online and offline  collabowriting  exercise  open to all members of the new coalition  was the Charter of Human Rights and Principles for the Internet  During 2009 and 2010 early drafts of the charter were refined  and vetted by a group of Human Rights experts to ensure that the charter was compatible with international human rights standards  Coalition members discussed and contributed to this drafting process at all stages  The final draft of the current version (Version 1 1) was opened for wider consultation within the IGF and by external commentators a few months after the first full draft (Version 1 0) was released at the 2010 IGF meeting in Vilnius  Lithuania  At this meeting a working party formed to condense the longer and legally complex charter into a more accessible format for outreach  education  and advocacy  The outcome was the aptly titled  Ten Punchy Principles  which were launched online and on the ground in 2011  A  translatothon  saw the Ten Principles take shape in 21 different languages with new translations being added all the time (http //internetrightsandprinciples org/site/campaign) 
The IRP Charter is a living document  In the fast-changing environment of increasing awareness that online we have rights too  the charter has been a formative contribution to the emerging area of internet governance principles  It has been a source of inspiration for rights-based initiatives from civil society  governments  and businesses committed to ensuring that the online environment is also a place where human rights are sustained and protected  The 2011 report of the UN Special Rapporteur on Freedom of Expression  Frank La Rue  and the 2012 landmark decision by the UN Human Rights Council on human rights and the internet have both affirmed the value of the Charter  The Charter 2 0 phase looks to consolidate and promote this work to a wider public

The 10 Internet Rights & Principles
are available for download in 22 languages at
http //internetrightsandprinciples org/site/campaign
The Internet offers unprecedented opportunities for the realisation of human rights  and plays an increasingly important role in our everyday lives  It is therefore essential that all actors  both public and private  respect and protect human rights on the Internet  Steps must also be taken to ensure that the Internet operates and evolves in ways that fulfil human rights to the greatest extent possible  To help realise this vision of a rights-based Internet environment  the 10 Rights and Principles are 
8
The Charter of Human Rights and Principles for the Internet
9
This Charter of Human Rights and Principles for the Internet has been developed by the Dynamic Coalition on Internet Rights and Principles and draws inspiration from the Association for Progressive Communications  Internet Rights Charter and other pertinent documents 
The Charter builds on the WSIS Declaration of Principles of Geneva and the Tunis Agenda for the Information Society  which both recognize that Information Communication Technologies (ICTs) present tremendous opportunities to enable individuals  communities and peoples to achieve their full potential in promoting their sustainable development and improving their quality of life  Like the WSIS Declaration  this Charter aims at building a people-centered information society  which respects and upholds fundamental human rights that are enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) 
This Charter interprets and explains universal human rights standards in a new context – the Internet  The Charter re-emphasizes that human rights apply online as they do offline  human rights standards  as defined in international law  are non-negotiable  The Charter also identifies internet policy principles which are necessary to fulfill human rights in the Internet age – to support and expand the capacity of the Internet as a medium for civil  political  economic  social and cultural development 
Under International law  states are legally obliged to respect  protect and fulfill the human rights of their citizens  Governments have the primary responsibility for realizing human rights within their jurisdictions  The duty to protect requires governments to protect against human rights violations committed by other actors  including businesses  States are also obliged to take appropriate steps to investigate  punish and redress human rights abuses which take place within their territory and/or jurisdiction 
However  other actors also have responsibilities under the International human rights regime  The Universal Declaration of Human Rights calls on  every individual and every organ of society  to promote and respect human rights  While these responsibilities do not equate to legal obligations (unless they have been enacted as such under national legislation) they do form part of prevailing social norms which companies and other private organizations should respect 
Thus while the primary responsibilities under the Charter remain with governments  the Charter also provides guidance to governments about how they must ensure that private companies are respecting human rights  and guidelines to companies about how they should behave so as to respect human rights in the Internet environment

are available for download in 22 languages at
http //internetrightsandprinciples org/site/campaign
The Internet offers unprecedented opportunities for the realisation of human rights  and plays an increasingly important role in our everyday lives  It is therefore essential that all actors  both public and private  respect and protect human rights on the Internet  Steps must also be taken to ensure that the Internet operates and evolves in ways that fulfil human rights to the greatest extent possible  To help realise this vision of a rights-based Internet environment  the 10 Rights and Principles are 

 African Stakeholders  Contribution to NetMundial

 

(This contribution is the collective effort of various African stakeholders active in the ICT and IG spaces  representing diverse sectorial  linguistic and geographic contexts )  

 

Agreement on the principles to be adopted under NetMundial should consider the following principles 

 

A      Internet Governance Principles

 

        The Internet is an inalienable public good that enables creativity  innovation and the emergence of new economic models 

 

        The Internet must retain its nature as an open-architecture tool for economic  social  cultural and scientific advancement 

 

        Globally accepted laws and standards that enable and protect human rights in everyday life should apply 

 

        Access to the Internet should be a universal right  It should be affordable  multilingual and open to all without censorship or restraint  Such access should be governed by a respect for minorities  linguistic and cultural diversity  intellectual property  freedom of expression and the privacy and protection of personal data  minorities and children 

 

        National regulatory agencies have a role to play in verifying the quality and consistency of services provided to end-users

 

        The technical management of the Internet should be inclusive  reliable  professional and transparent  It should adhere to the principles of multi-stakeholderism as stated in the Tunis Agenda for the Information Society 

 

        Critical Internet resources (including root servers  IP addresses  autonomous system numbers and spectral resources) must be governed by international law within a multi-stakeholder framework that ensures the Internet remains open and non-segmented 

 

        A secure Internet is one in which all peoples rights and freedoms are protected  Governments must continue to ensure that the security and protection of citizens is balanced by the protection of their rights and freedoms as enshrined in international laws 

 

        The general principles of neutrality  inclusion  access to and transparency of the Internet underlie all these suggested principles 

 

B      Road map for further evolution of the Internet Governance Ecosystem

 

The road map for the evolution of Internet Governance must integrate models and mechanisms that are inclusive  transparent and neutral and serve the global public interest  The regional  national and global Internet Governance Forums as established by the Tunis Agenda are important  Specifically 

 

        Representation must be cross-sectorial with a balance of powers and responsibilities across stakeholders  It should support/adopt the multi-stakeholder model in accordance with paragraph 35 of the Tunis Agenda 

 

        Mechanisms must be in place to enable the effective participation of all stakeholders across all geographic regions particularly those from developing and least developed countries 

 

        Engagement and interaction between various actors must be strengthened to improve the quality and outcomes of the Internet Governance Forum and lead to increased influence on policy and governance of the Internet 

 

        The community must commit to clearly defining the role of government and other stakeholders in a multi-stakeholder environment that respects freedom and openness 

 

        While operational and technical management and maintenance of the integrity of the Internet is the responsibility of the private sector and specialized technical professional communities  all stakeholders should have a say in how the Internet evolves  develops and is governed 

The Importance of a Multistakeholder Approach to Cybersecurity Effectiveness
1  Introduction

Most Internet security threats are increasingly complex  affecting multiple stakeholders at the same time  and requiring coordinated efforts to be detected and mitigated   This is specially true to incidents involving botnets  spam  malware and DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) attacks 

The scenario gets more complicated when critical national infrastructures are connected to the Internet  becoming exposed to the same vulnerabilities as other systems  and can be attacked by the same tools or techniques used for attacks in other contexts 

The protection of critical infrastructures and government networks connected to the Internet have both Internet security and defense aspects - the protection of these infrastructures is done most of the time by government organizations   What is worrisome is that we are increasingly seeing purely Internet security issues being perceived by governments as purely defense issues   This is leading to a scenario where  for example  the vital cooperation already existing among CERTs (Computer Emergency Response Teams) with National Responsibility being undermined by a tendency to move all existing Internet security capabilities into government or intelligence organizations 

The Internet ecosystem's security  stability and resilience should remain multistakeholder  The cooperation among different sectors and stakeholders  already existing today  is key to mitigate most of the current threats 

In the remainder of this proposal  we will briefly discuss several current multistakeholder forums and initiatives  pointing out their strengths  and bringing to attention issues that need to be considered when discussing a framework to improve the multistakeholder approach in order to achieve more effective cybersecurity 
2  Existing Multistakeholder Forums

There are some international forums that already exist today and that congregate different stakeholders  cooperating to handle security incidents and mitigate specific threats   Most of these forums were created to mitigate specific categories of attacks or threats   As nowadays the threat landscape changed and there is a prevalence of what is technically referred to as combined threats  most of these organizations are dealing with similar security issues   What follows is a description of each one of these organizations 
2 1  FIRST - Forum of Incident Response and Security Teams

FIRST is the Forum of Incident Response and Security Teams - http //first org/   A Computer Security and Incident Response Team (CSIRT)  sometimes also referred as CERT  is a service organization that is responsible for receiving  reviewing  and responding to computer security incident reports and activity  Their services are usually performed for a defined constituency that could be a parent entity such as a corporate  governmental  or educational organization; a region or country; a research network; or a paid client (Source  http //www cert org/incident-management/csirt-development/csirt-faq cfm) 

The first CSIRT  the CERT Coordination Center  was created in November 1988  after the security incident known as "Internet worm" or "Morris worm" brought major portions of the Internet to its knees  and made clear the need to more coordinated efforts to respond to security incidents on the Internet   After this incident  several other teams were created  The FIRST was formed in 1990 in response to a second worm  the "Wank worm"  and this incident highlighted the need for better communication and coordination among teams of different organizations 

FIRST is an international confederation of trusted computer incident response teams who cooperatively handle computer security incidents and promote incident prevention programs   FIRST brings together a wide variety of CSIRTs from around the globe including educational  commercial  vendor  national  government and military   FIRST members develop and share technical information  tools  methodologies  processes and best practices  and use their combined knowledge  skills and experience to promote a safer and more secure Internet environment 
2 2   CSIRTs with National Responsibility and the NatCSIRT Annual Meeting

Since 2006  the CERT(R) Coordination Center (CERT/CC) has been hosting an annual technical meeting for CSIRTs with national responsibility  This meeting provides an opportunity for the organizations responsible for protecting the security of nations  economies  and critical infrastructures to discuss the unique challenges they face while fulfilling this role   As a result of these meetings  an online Forum is maintained throughout the year  as well as a list of CSIRTs with National Responsibility  http //www cert org/incident-management/national-csirts/national-csirts cfm

It is noteworthy that there are very different models of National CSIRTs  ranging from not for profit  to academic  to government teams  Also  several countries have more than one team  demonstrating the complexity of increasing cybersecurity and performing incident handling at a national level 
2 3  APWG

APWG (http //apwg org/) was founded in 2003 as the Anti-Phishing Working Group  at which time its mission was to counter phishing attacks   But  as the technology evolved  APWG is not focused only on phishing anymore  but on mitigating other attacks that are used to perpetrate cybercrime   APWG has more than 2000 members and research partners worldwide  from financial institutions  retailers  solutions providers  ISPs  telcos  CSIRTs  universities  defense contractors  law enforcement agencies  trade groups  treaty organizations and government agencies 
2 4  MAAWG - The Messaging  Malware and Mobile Anti-Abuse Working Group

MAAWG is The Messaging  Malware and Mobile Anti-Abuse Working Group (http //www maawg org/) and brings the messaging industry together to work collaboratively and to successfully address the various forms of messaging abuse  such as spam  viruses  denial-of-service attacks and other messaging exploitations   To accomplish this  MAAWG develops initiatives in the three areas necessary to resolve the messaging abuse problem  industry collaboration  technology  and public policy 
2 5  ISOC - The Internet Society

ISOC - The Internet Society (http //www internetsociety org/) - is an organization dedicated to ensuring that the Internet stays open and transparent  It has initiatives in Internet policy  technology standards  and future development   ISOC has a special project called "Combating Spam Project"  in partnership with MAAWG  dedicated to demonstrating to policy makers  clearly and effectively  the tools and industry partnerships that are available to tackle spam 
3  Examples of Successful Multistakeholder International and National Initiatives

In the past few years  CSIRTs  Network Operators and members of the aforementioned forums became involved in some specific projects and working groups aimed at mitigating specific big threats  implementing best practices or better understanding the Internet threat environment   In this section we are going to describe some of these successful multistakeholder initiatives 
3 1  The Conficker Working Group

Starting in late 2008  and continuing through June of 2010  a coalition of security researchers worked to resist an Internet borne attack carried out by malicious software known as Conficker  This coalition became known as "The Conficker Working Group"  and seemed to be successful in a number of ways  not the least of which was unprecedented cooperation between organizations and individuals around the world  in both the public and private sectors (Source  http //www confickerworkinggroup org/) 

The work of this group involved members of Internet Governance Bodies  Software and Hardware Vendors  Content providers  Universities and Research Centers  and was vital to mitigate the worm's malicious payloads and to help clean systems throughout the Internet   A Lessons Learned document can be find in the previously listed homepage 
3 2  DNS-changer Working Group

The DNS Changer Working Group (DCWG - http //www dcwg org/) was an ad hoc group of subject matter experts  and included members from organizations such as Georgia Tech  Internet Systems Consortium  Mandiant  National Cyber-Forensics and Training Alliance  Neustar  Spamhaus  Team Cymru  Trend Micro  and the University of Alabama at Birmingham   The work of the DCWG was coordinated with FBI investigations  and received help from several National CERTs and ISPs 

This working group was created to help remediate Rove Digital's malicious DNS servers   The botnet operated by Rove Digital altered user DNS settings  pointing victims to malicious DNS in data centers in Estonia  New York  and Chicago  The malicious DNS servers would give fake  malicious answers  altering user searches  and promoting fake and dangerous products  Because every web search starts with DNS  the malware showed users an altered version of the Internet 

The cooperation among all these stakeholders made it possible to gradually alert and help disinfect the end users' devices  without disrupting their access to the Internet 
3 3  Multistakeholder initiatives at a National level

There are several multistakeholder initiatives at a National level  In this section we will briefly describe some of these initiatives 
3 3 1  The Dutch Cyber Security Council

The Dutch Cyber Security Council has 15 members from government  industry  and the scientific community  for a total of three scientists  six public sector and six private sector representatives  The Council is supported by an independent secretariat   The Council oversees the Dutch National Cyber Security Strategy and offers both solicited and unsolicited advice to the Dutch government and society  The role that the Council played during the DigiNotar incident  for example  demonstrated the effectiveness of this kind of public-private partnership in the digital domain 

In July 2013  the Council issued an advice on the new National Cyber Security Strategy  published in October 2013  The advice specifically focused on the need for close cooperation and coordination in the field of incident detection and response  Only through active information sharing  timely response and seamless collaboration can a secure digital environment be established

3 3 2  The Japanese Cyber Clean Center

The Cyber Clean Center (CCC) is a core organization taking a role to promote bot cleaning and prevention of re-infection of users' computers  which were once infected by bots  based on cooperation among government  software vendors and ISPs   The Cyber Clean Center has a Steering Committee and three working groups in the layer below  the bot countermeasure system operation group; the bot program analysis group; and the bot infection prevention promotion group

3 3 3  CGI br Port 25 Management Initiative

For a long time  Brazil was present on most spam rankings as a top spam relaying country  Determined to reverse this situation  the Brazilian Internet Steering Committee (CGI br) has conducted  since 2005  a number of activities  such as academic studies and technical analyses  which lead to the adoption of Port 25 management as the most effective measure to be taken to prevent spammers from abusing the Brazilian broadband infrastructure  This initiative was lead by CGI br's Anti-Spam Working Group (CT-Spam)  which provided a forum where different stakeholders were able to meet 

For almost 20 years  Brazil has developed a model of multistakeholder Internet governance  Therefore  a measure of such importance as the blocking of outgoing port 25 traffic in residential networks could not be adopted without all sectors affected being asked to contribute to this decision-making process 

Bringing together the experience of more than a dozen telecom companies  thousands of Internet service providers  representatives of civil society and the academic community  as well as the technical staff of CGI br  the process of adopting Port 25 management was broadly discussed   This was specially important because the implementation required a concerted effort  with e-mail service providers making sure they offered Message Submission via a different port (587)  and migrated at least 90% of their users' base before broadboand providers could block outbound port 25 traffic 

It is also important to highlight that both the National Telecommunications Agency (Anatel) and the Ministry of Justice have played a key role in providing support for the telecom companies and the consumer protection entities respectively  Anatel signed a Cooperation Agreement with CGI br  which gave the telecom companies legal grounds to proceed with the adoption  The Ministry of Justice  on the other hand  published a Technical Note explaining the benefits of such measures for consumers 

As a result of this initiative  Brazil is no longer listed as one of the top spam relaying countries in the world  according to several public rankings

3 3 4  CERT br - Computer Emergency Response Team Brazil

CERT br is the Computer Emergency Response Team Brazil  maintained by NIC br  a not for profit organization created to implement the decisions and projects designed by the Brazilian Internet Steering Committee - CGI br   All CERT br activities take into account the need to involve all stakeholders to successfully increase the level of security and incident handling capacity of the networks connected to the Internet in Brazil 

Besides doing Incident Handling activities  CERT br also works to increase security awareness in the Brazilian community  maintaining an early warning project with the goal of identifying new trends and correlating security events  as well as alerting Brazilian networks involved in malicious activities  CERT br also helps new Computer Security Incident Response Teams (CSIRTs) to establish their activities in the country 

A clear example of the success of this approach is the Brazilian Distributed Honeypots Project  which  through a network of distributed honeypots in the Brazilian Internet space  increases the capacity of incident detection  event correlation and trend analysis in the country   These honeypots are passive sensors that provide valuable situational awareness  without collecting production traffic neither performing any type of surveillance   This project has sensors in more than 40 Brazilian partner organizations  ranging from government and energy sectors  to academia  ISPs and Telecommunication Providers

4  The need for improvement of the multistakeholder collaboration in cybersecurity

Achieving a satisfactory level of Internet Security is not an easy task  but the experience accumulated by several successful initiatives demonstrates that  in order to be effective  any cybersecurity initiative needs to involve several stakeholders  More than that  the reality is that more often than not  the security measures need to be taken by systems administrators  network operators or security professionals in their own networks  However  cooperation with others is key to be able to understand the threats and better evaluate the effectiveness of their actions 

In the document "Conficker Working Group  Lessons Learned" (http //www confickerworkinggroup org/wiki/uploads/Conficker_Working_Group_Lessons_Learned_17_June_2010_final pdf)  published in January 2011  although the word "multistakeholder" is not used  some of the success factors listed point to the importance of cooperation and the involvement of different stakeholders   Here are some examples 

    Utilize a trust model; the scope of the working group needs to be a manageable size to be effective and include those directly affected  and yet large enough to include a broader universe of those impacted 
    Incorporate a consensus model without hierarchy to allow the group to adapt and respond to fast changing conditions 
    Gain the participation and support of key governing and regulatory bodies 
    Formalize communications with stakeholder groups vs  relying on social networks 

These four points bring to light issues like the rapid change of the threat landscape  the need for rapid communication  the involvement and support of governments and the fact that several stakeholders need to cooperate 

Although the Conficker Working Group was very successful  as well as other initiatives listed in the previous section  there are still some stakeholders that could improve their cooperation  For example 

    Network Operator Groups (NOGs) and Regional Internet Registries (RIRs) should be more involved with security issues   There are some areas like routing security (and newly proposed protocols like RPKI or SBGP) or DNSSEC that need worldwide adoption to be effective   RIRs could also work more closely with the CSIRT community to improve the WHOIS system to help the incident handling process 
    Software vendors need to become involved and be more pro-active; after all  most of the security problems we face today are software-related problems   The real challenge is to improve software security and get the software industry to a more mature level 
    The governments  including military and intelligence sectors  in addition to traditional security and defense strategies  need to improve their awareness of the multistakeholder nature of the Internet and the vital importance of the cooperation to address security threats   They need to participate more in the national and international security forums and improve cooperation with other stakeholders 

Considering government cyber security strategies  it is noteworthy that about 130 parties  including public and private parties  knowledge institutions and social organisations  were involved in the drafting of the Dutch "National Cyber Security Strategy 2 - From awareness to capability" (NCSS2) (https //www ncsc nl/english/current-topics/news/new-cyber-security-strategy-strengthens-cooperation-between-government-and-businesses html)  The strategy starts with the following statement 

    "We are moving from structures to coalitions in which all parties -- national and international -- are represented in order to achieve supported standards "

And adds that

    "The correlation between security  freedom and social-economic benefits proposed in the NCSS2 is a dynamic balance that is intended to be realised in a constantly open and pragmatic dialogue between all stakeholders  both national and international  (   ) In order to bring the dialogue about cyber security between the various stakeholders to a new level of maturity  the following three management areas are of the utmost importance  (self) regulation  transparency and knowledge development "

This is a good example of the recognition of the importance of a multistakeholder approach to the Internet ecosystem's security  stability and resilience 
5  Recommendations

As stated before  achieving a satisfactory level of Internet Security is not an easy task  and the multistakeholder initiatives previously discussed are good examples of frameworks that can effectively deal with cybersecurity current and emerging issues   Therefore  it is recommended that all national and international organizations involved with Internet Governance  for instance  Local Governments  RIRs  United Nations  European Union  ISOC Chapters  among others  should take the following into consideration 

    The experience accumulated by the several successful initiatives described in this contribution demonstrates that  in order to be effective  any cybersecurity initiative depends on cooperation among different stakeholders  and it can't be achieved via a single organization or structure 
    There are stakeholders that still need to become more involved  like network operators and software developers 
    Governments  including military and intelligence sectors  in addition to traditional security and defense strategies  need to improve their awareness of the multistakeholder nature of the Internet and the vital importance of cooperation to address security threats   They need to participate more in the national and international security forums and improve cooperation with other stakeholders 
    There is room and a need for new forums and initiatives  but they should not replace existing structures   Any new initiative should aim at leveraging and improving the multistakeholder structures already in place today 

OECD Contribution to the Internet Governance Principles
The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) provides a multi-stakeholder policy forum to maximise the benefits of information and communication technologies and the Internet as drivers of innovation  productivity  growth  sustainable development and social well-being 
The OECD has developed guidelines to assist governments in encouraging an open and unified Internet  thereby supporting the fundamental and increasing role it plays for economic and social development  In undertaking this work  the approach to standard setting has been one of multi-stakeholder consultation and openness  For over two decades  OECD work has covered domestic and cross-border legal and regulatory  technical and educational issues related to the Internet economy  including communication infrastructure and services  cybersecurity  critical information infrastructures  privacy and consumer protection 
In 2011  consistent with the growing recognition of the critical role played by the Internet  the OECD community came together  through a multi-stakeholder process  to draw on the experience of all participants in good practices for Internet governance  This led to the adoption of the OECD Recommendation on Internet Policy Making Principles  This work is of particular relevance for the discussions to take place in the NETmundial Conference in São Paulo  and through this submission  the OECD is pleased to offer these Principles as contribution to the Conference 
The Principles were endorsed by all 34 Member countries  along with Colombia  Costa Rica  Egypt and Lithuania  aiming to maintain and enhance the open nature of the Internet  The goals include sharing policies and practices to attain the greatest practical coverage and use while protecting privacy  security  children online  intellectual property  and the free flow of information  The Principles  set out below  support a flexible  multi-stakeholder approach to Internet policy making and strengthened international co-operation 
OECD Contribution to the Internet Governance Principles
The Principles are 
1  Promote and protect the global free flow of information;
2  Promote the open  distributed and interconnected nature of the Internet;
3  Promote investment and competition in high speed networks and services;
4  Promote and enable the cross-border delivery of services;
5  Encourage multi-stakeholder co-operation in policy development processes;
6  Foster voluntarily developed codes of conduct;
7  Develop capacities to bring publicly available  reliable data into the policy-making process;
8  Ensure transparency  fair process  and accountability;
9  Strengthen consistency and effectiveness in privacy protection at a global level;
10  Maximise individual empowerment;
11  Promote creativity and innovation;
12  Limit Internet intermediary liability;
13  Encourage co-operation to promote Internet security;
14  Give appropriate priority to enforcement efforts 
The Internet has had profound and wide reaching affects on economies and societies around the world  It benefits individuals  businesses and governments through a large variety of digital goods and services  The OECD believes that the openness of the Internet and the multi-stakeholder framework have been key factors enabling society to reap the benefits of this platform by stimulating innovation and economic opportunities  as well as enabling people to give voice to democratic aspirations 
With this contribution and conscious of the fact that the current Internet Governance Model can be strengthened and improved  the OECD presents the Internet Policy-Making Principles listed above as a roadmap to advance the much-needed global dialogue  This contribution also maps below OECD guidance and relevant work that underpins the Principles 
The NETmundial meeting will provide an important platform to evolve towards shared principles for building a sound Internet ecosystem  In this regard  the OECD looks forward to continue its engagement in this important process 

The Internet Association s Internet Governance Principles Submission
Global Multi-Stakeholder Meeting on the Future of the Internet Governance
April 23 - April 24  2014 (São Paulo  Brazil)
The Internet Association  a trade association representing leading Internet companies1 
appreciates the opportunity to provide comments on principles for Internet governance in
advance of the upcoming Global Multi-Stakeholder Meeting on the Future of the Internet
Governance  We welcome the Brazilian government  CGI br  and /1net s efforts in convening
all stakeholders to discuss the critical issue of Internet governance  Our member companies
understand the importance of preserving the Internet s successful multi-stakeholder model and
rely on its open  bottom-up model to ensure that global citizens are able to access and take
advantage of this growing platform 
With almost 3 billion users around the globe  the Internet is a transformative platform for
technological innovation  democratic discourse  and economic growth  According to a March
2012 report by the Boston Consulting Group  small-and medium size businesses (SMEs) -
proven engines of economic growth - contribute significantly to the Internet economy  which
will grow to $4 2 trillion in G-20 economies 2 SMEs have played an essential role in the Web s
development as a mechanism for creating jobs and generating revenue 3 For instance  in Brazil 
SMEs that rely heavily on the Internet take advantage of the Web to engage consumers and drive
increased sales 4

In addition to facilitating economic growth  the Internet s important role as a forum for free
expression is undeniable  The International Telecommunication Union s Secretary General
previously recognized in a draft report that the Internet alters the global economy by creating
opportunities in local communities and acting as a driver for social change 5 During the Tunisia
and Egypt uprising  we witnessed how the Internet s open and decentralized ecosystem allowed
citizens to exercise their basic human rights  These citizens used Web services to dispel
misinformation  organize  and communicate with not only each other but also the rest of the
world 
To further promote the Internet s inclusive  multi-stakeholder model  we highlight the following
high-level principles for future Internet governance 
1) Expanding broadband access  The Internet is a gateway to knowledge  cultures  services 
commerce  and communication  Internet users deserve the ability to freely access this
information to enjoy the economical and societal benefits available online  In the case of
SMEs previously mentioned  these businesses in developing countries often cite poor
access to technology as a significant barrier 6 Governance should promote the expansion
of access to broadband networks for all of the world s citizens to engage in this
participatory platform 
2) Promoting the free flow of information  In addition to promoting increased access by
global Internet users  any model of governance must promote the free flow of information 
which is critical to the knowledge sharing  self-expression  and assembly that are
characteristic of the Internet 
3) Increasing Inclusiveness  Individual users  governments  civil society  businesses 
academics  and members of the technical community drive the Internet s decentralized

model  All of these stakeholders are invested in the continued success of the Internet and
have a stake in preserving it as a critical platform for communication and information
exchange  The process of reaching decisions regarding the future model of Internet
governance must be inclusive of this diverse and knowledgeable group 
4) Maintaining user trust  Given that the Internet is integral to all aspects of our daily lives 
stakeholders must preserve its security  stability  and resiliency  Our member companies
are committed to maintaining Internet users  trust when they access and interact with our
companies  online services  As Internet users access personalized services and
information online  they trust that their online experience will be secure  Governments
should recognize limitations on their ability to collect information on Internet users  that
respect users  privacy interests  Internet governance policies should also encourage
openness  transparency  and accountability 
The Internet Association believes that maintaining the Internet s current  open model is critical to
the continued success of the platform but also to future economic prosperity around the globe 
Internet governance should foster innovation and technical development while creating economic
opportunities at all levels  Implementing the principles outlined above will ensure that
stakeholders preserve the Internet as an important platform for commerce  trade  and
communication  We look forward to our continued engagement on this issue

0  Preamble

 

The Panel on Global Internet Cooperation and Governance Mechanisms has been assembled to provide input into the global debate on Internet governance  The Panel s work is evolving  a final report is anticipated for May 2014 

 

The following contribution to NETMundial is derived from the Panel s current discussions  It consists of a set of Internet governance principles and outlines the Panel s current (and still evolving) effort to develop a roadmap for operationalizing these principles 

 
1  Introduction and Framing

 

The Internet is without doubt one of the largest cooperative effort ever undertaken by humankind  What allowed the emergence of this complex dynamic ecosystem is a common set of protocols  developed and continuously refined through open and participatory processes in an ecosystem of complementary technical institutions  As a result  it smoothly grew in a few decades to more than 3 billion users and will have to handle several additional billions of users and devices in the years to come 

In addition  during the last two decades  the Internet has enabled a myriad of applications  the most visible of which is the World Wide Web  They have  to an extent never seen before  enabled people to  seek  receive and impart information and ideas [   ] regardless of frontiers   as envisaged by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights  The end result is the creation of (cyber)spaces where a constantly growing part of humanity s social and economic interactions are now taking place 

As the number and diversity of users increase  however  the cross-border nature of these interactions expose growing tensions with an international patchwork of social and legal norms  requiring structured mechanisms of cooperation to handle this issue  Furthermore  despite the availability and success of the many active and distributed Internet governance mechanisms  networks  and institutions  stakeholders still face challenges  For example  some stakeholders and governments from least developed countries find it difficult to determine where to turn to address their issues within the web of Internet governance  These stakeholders can have difficulty finding clear choices that directly address their most pressing concerns on a national and global level  This is especially the case with emerging non-technical issues  Such challenges contribute to these stakeholders feeling marginalized in global Internet governance 
2  Internet Governance Principles

 

The Panel has identified eleven Internet governance principles that build upon a multistakeholder framework as the foundation for effective Internet governance 

Unified

1  An un-fragmented  interconnected  interoperable  secure  stable  resilient  sustainable  and trust­-building Internet;

 

Dynamic

2  Distributed  lean  evolving  and adapting  and able to address issues in innovative ways;

 

Inclusive

3  Inclusive opportunity for participation and access for all stakeholders  representing multiple interests;

 

Diverse

4  Respect for  and inclusion of  diverse interests and cultures;

 

Equitable

5  No one single stakeholder  or category of stakeholders  dominates at the expense of others;

 

Collaborative

6  Decision-­making is informed and enabled through bottom-­up  transparent  and participatory stakeholder collaboration;

 

Local

7  Seek to resolve issues at a level closest to their origin;

 

Stewardship

8  Serve the global public interest by placing good management  use  and evolution of the Internet above any individual interest in it;

 

Low Barriers

9  Lower barriers to leverage the Internet as a global force for development and actively encourage its developmental role amongst stakeholders  especially the marginalized;

 

Human Rights

10  Support the fundamental rights and freedoms of all people affected by the Internet;

 

Accountable

11  Accountable  transparent  and rooted in public stewardship;

 
3  Roadmap to Operationalizing the Principles

 

To ensure the continuing success of an Internet based on the principles described above  the global community must address three complementary challenges 

 

First  the elaborate ecosystem of cooperating institutions governing the technical issues of the Internet must continue to evolve and globalize their participation and structures;

 

Second  accessible and collaborative governance mechanisms are needed for the Internet s non-technical issues where possible  drawing on the lessons learned from the successful ecosystem of technical governance;

 

Third  Internet governance capacities should be broadened and developed across all stakeholder categories at the global  regional  national  and local levels  thus empowering stakeholders to effectively navigate  participate  and address emerging issues in a distributed  collaborative  and dynamic Internet governance ecosystem;

 

And fourth  as the Internet grows to include additional billions of users  the resulting increase in diversity risks exacerbating existing differences in social and legal norms   Accommodating this challenge will require a renewed effort at finding areas of commonality rather than discord and openness to accepting diversity as an opportunity for enrichment rather than as an pretext for division 

 

The Panel is exploring a number of options to address these challenges 

 

The following reflects the Panel s current and still evolving view on a roadmap forward to operationalize the Principles above 

 
a) Issue-to-Solution Mapping

 

New mechanisms to map issues to solutions are needed 

Such mechanisms help stakeholders map issues to appropriate institutions or governance networks that are addressing the issues at a global  regional  national  or local level 

 

Such mapping would solve the often-cited difficulty especially in least developed countries with limited resources ­­to navigate the growing complexity of the Internet governance ecosystem  Issue mapping would also assist in identifying gaps in current institutions or governance networks and address the concerns that arise as a result of a multitude of choices  ­­or not enough clear choices­­  that directly respond to stakeholders' most pressing concerns 

 

When a new issue emerges  these mechanisms effectively identify and engage the relevant institutions  groups  and/or experts and coalesce them to address the issue effectively 

 
b) National and Regional Internet Governance Structures

 

New localized mechanisms and structures are needed 

Panel discussions have acknowledged that not all Internet governance issues can be solved within the global level  Different cultures and their respective needs are sometimes better reflected in local decision-making processes 

National and regional level Internet governance structures and mechanisms must emerge  guided by the same global principles to ensure alignment  The synchronization between the different levels ensures a healthy  inclusive  and balanced stakeholder representation locally while contributing to the coordination of activities taking place at the global level and avoiding additional frictions in the Internet 

 
c) ICANN Globalization

 

ICANN needs to further globalize 

Based on the aforementioned Equitable principle  ICANN needs to further globalize its structures  operations  commitments  and legal framework 

 

ICANN has the steadfast role as the global administrator of the IANA functions  operating the names  numbers  and protocol registries in collaboration and based on established agreements and input from the relevant Internet technical organizations  For over fifteen years without a single interruption since ICANN's inception  this performance continues to support a global Internet 

 

However  ICANN can now move beyond the U S  government s stewardship that assured the world of ICANN s performance to date  While this arrangement was arguably necessary during ICANN s growth phase  the current maturity of ICANN s structures  processes  and accountability mechanisms warrants the transitioning of the U S  role to the ICANN community 

 

ICANN must pursue this transition through multistakeholder developed accountability mechanisms coupled with the strengthening of mutual commitments and agreements with relevant Internet communities and organizations  Such a transition should be done carefully to maintain ICANN s established operation that provides the stability and resiliency of the core Internet technical identifiers 

 
d) Forums and Dialogues

Global  regional  and national forums and dialogues on Internet governance issues must be strengthened 

 

The Panel encourages the strengthening of multiple and diverse forums and dialogues - online and offline - between stakeholders from business  technology  government  civil society  and academic environments on a broad range of technical and non­technical issues 

 

Forums and dialogues are an indispensable part of the Internet governance ecosystem  open to all stakeholders from all countries for equal participation  and wherein any stakeholder can bring up any issue  With light management structures  bottom-­up organization of workshops  extensive use of remote participation tools  and holistic  substantive mandates  such forums are unparalleled catalysts for the global exchange of ideas and experiences across the full range of Internet governance issues  Additionally  these forums serve as incubators and test beds for a variety of new collaborative formations  such as national and regional forums that enhance local policy landscapes  as well as issue­-specific dynamic mechanisms 

 

The interactions in open forums and dialogues contribute greatly to the mechanisms that provide solutions for existing and emerging issues ­­ across the local  national  regional  or global levels 

 
e) Expert Communities

 

Expert communities are needed to support Internet governance structures and mechanisms 

Expert communities are open and collaborative groups of experts in research and practice to inform and support Internet governance through knowledge-­sharing and expertise  These communities enrich discourse and collective learning  iterating  and contributing at local  national  regional  and global levels to the resolution of issues 

These communities vary in many dimensions  but they are vital sources for the exchange of people  ideas  and lessons learned that can percolate throughout the ecosystem and replenish and expand human capital  knowledge  and perspectives for the stakeholders across the ecosystem 

Expert communities should be mostly organic  requiring a minimum organizational mechanism  which is often effectively delivered through an online platform 

 
f) Empowerment and Development

 

More empowerment  development  and tools are needed to enable Internet governance mechanisms and structures at the global  regional  and national levels 

 

Empowerment programs and toolkits enable and strengthen stakeholders and groups that form governance structures and participate in governance networks 

 

These developmental activities provide training on Internet governance  processes  skills  and tools ­­ spanning technical  legal  and policy areas  These programs are vital for the growing need to support local  national  and regional governance networks that address local issues  while ensuring local/national/regional synchronization between all stakeholders 

 

Technical organizations  governments  international organizations  private foundations  or local  national  and multilateral development agencies should deliver the empowerment programs  Collectively  these programs represent an enormously effective  and yet low­-cost investment  building the human capital to sustain a thriving and diverse Internet governance ecosystem  Toolkits should also be made available for existing or emerging stakeholders as shared resources  in multiple languages  to enable effective administration and collaboration between stakeholders and groups 

 

Note The Panel does not have all the answers but is actively seeking community input from the NETmundial conference and other forums  The Panel remains engaged in deep and thoughtful reflection to address several remaining questions in order to effectively operationalize the distributed and collaborative governance of the internet 

 

As such  the Panel is committed to providing practical answers to many questions such as these 

 

- How  when and who decides whether an issue requires global coordination or devolution  How do we make these decisions thoughtfully yet at a rapid enough pace to ensure stability 

 

- Who will and how to monitor adherence to principles of Internet governance - ensuring accountability  What incentives can assure compliance and the public interest 

 

- How to accommodate new technologies and issues arising in a dynamic environment  affording stability without undermining innovation 

 

- How to coordinate across issue areas (where a clear distinction between technical and non-technical; content and code; infrastructure and trade are hard to make) 

 

- What platforms are needed in order to operationalize effective and legitimate forms of decision-making 

 

- How to ensure that the growing machine-to-machine internet traffic (currently at over 60% of total) is operated based on the same governance principles and frameworks of human use 

 

The panel will continue to evolve and advance its discussion towards delivering a comprehensive report with a practical roadmap for the evolution and operationalization of distributed and collaborative Internet governance  The final report will be published in May 2014 

The key prerequisite for any fruitful policy-making discussion is a shared vernacular among participants  i e  all actors put the same meaning behind the same words 

 

This contribution is therefore an issue-framing input to advance the collective understanding of NETmundial participants of the expression  roadmap for the further evolution of the Internet governance ecosystem   It will analyze each component of it in turn and propose a few questions to help shape the discussion during the meeting regarding the way forward 

 

Hereby  an important point of reference is the definition of Internet governance agreed during the WSIS Tunis Summit   the development and application by governments  the private sector and civil society  in their respective roles  of shared principles  norms  rules  decision-making procedures  and programmes that shape the evolution and use of the Internet  (Art 34 of the Tunis Agenda) 

 

1  INTERNET GOVERNANCE IS ABOUT THE ELABORATION AND IMPLEMENTATION OF REGIMES

 

a) Regimes  The Tunis Agenda definition clearly echoes the widely accepted definition of a regime as   sets of implicit or explicit principles  norms  rules  and decision-making procedures around which actors  expectations converge in a given area of international relations  (Krasner  1983) 

 

Internet governance is therefore about the various arrangements or regimes ( shared principles  norms  rules  decision-making procedures  and programmes ) that allow concerned stakeholders to address specific issues regarding the Internet 

 

b) Elaboration and implementation  The Tunis definition mentions the  development and application  of such arrangements or regimes as two complementary dimensions of Internet governance  This means appropriate processes to develop standards and policies and - when needed - dedicated institutions to implement them operationally   

 

Experience demonstrates that stakeholders that will be needed for the implementation of standards or policy frameworks need to actively participate in their elaboration 

 

2  THE MULTISTAKEHOLDER INTERNET GOVERNANCE ECOSYSTEM

 

a) Involvement of all stakeholders  Internet governance is described in the Tunis Agenda as the responsibility of  governments  the private sector and civil society  in their respective roles   Although this is generally considered as the endorsement of the multistakeholder approach by the Heads of State gathered in Tunis  the term  respective roles  was voluntarily ambiguous and widely divergent interpretations remain 

 

We believe however that it should not be understood as a pre-established and rigid structural separation of responsibilities between stakeholder groups  Rather  there is a need to identify and engage  on an issue-by-issue basis  the relevant stakeholders from each group  who either have a direct influence on the issue or are impacted by it and must thus be associated with developing a solution 

 

Furthermore  in a multistakeholder approach  the respective roles are not set in stone  the involvement of the different stakeholders can vary according to the issues addressed  the venue where they are discussed and the stage of the discussion  There is not a single way to implement a multi-stakeholder model 

 

b) The existing institutional ecosystem  A distributed set of institutions and processes (including IETF  W3C  the RIRs or ICANN) already exists to handle the different issues related to the governance of the Internet as a system  This existing ecosystem produces many types of arrangements  from a distributed repartition of responsibilities in the allocation of resources (the RIRs)  to voluntary technical standards (IETF and W3C)  to enforceable contracts (ICANN) 

 

Although their modus operandi is highly variable  these processes and institutions are open to all willing participants and their multi-stakeholder nature was essential to enable the network to successfully grow and serve close to 3 billion users 

 

3  EVOLVING THE SYSTEM FURTHER

 

If the multi-stakeholder Internet governance ecosystem is the set of mechanisms and institutions that allow the development and implementation of shared issue-based regimes by different stakeholders  what needs to be  evolved further  in this ecosystem  Discussions so far seem to have identified three complementary tracks in that regard 

 

Track 1  The first task in front of us is to continue to improve the existing system in terms of inclusion  transparency and accountability  NETmundial will help actors understand where discussions on these aspects are currently under way and how they can engage 

 

Track 2  A second discussion concerns the globalization of ICANN and in particular the current role played by the US Department of Commerce in the workflow of the so-called IANA function  Evolution seems now possible in a topic that was considered taboo for a long time and NETmundial will naturally address it 

 

Track 3  However  a third dimension is essential and deserves close attention during NETmundial  How to handle governance ON the Internet  This is the one we would like to focus upon here 

 

The Tunis definition of Internet governance covers  the evolution and use of the Internet   a distinction that can be referred to as  governance OF the Internet and governance ON the Internet  Governance OF the Internet deals with the Internet as a network system  while governance ON the Internet deals with the rules applicable to how people use the network 

 

Contrary to what many might believe  this distinction is not a separation between technical and policy issues  there are policy dimensions to technical issues and technical aspects in policy decisions  What is at stake is rather a distinction between two different challenges  on the one hand ensuring the interoperability  security and resilience of the network itself; and on the other hand managing the coexistence of different norms in cross-border spaces  The Internet is based on a layered architecture and its governance should be layered too 

 

The current ecosystem of multi-stakeholder institutions mainly deals with the governance OF the Internet as a system (protocols and standards  allocations of addresses  and names policy)  But governance ON the Internet lacks similar multi-stakeholder processes and structures to handle challenges related to the use of the network  i e  on the application  content and social layers 

 

A key meaning of  further evolving the multistakeholder internet governance ecosystem  is therefore  how to develop global processes and - if needed - institutions to handle issues related to the use of the Internet  such as privacy  freedom of expression  cybercrime  etc… In other terms  what could be the overarching framework that can produce multi-stakeholder  distributed and issue-based regimes to address these issues 

 

A key aspect of this discussion will be how any evolving multi-stakeholder Internet governance ecosystem integrates existing policy-making structures at the local and global level  including nation-states and intergovernmental organizations  Another important question is the evolution of the role and responsibilities of the Internet Governance Forum (IGF) 

 

4  DEFINING THE COMPONENTS OF A ROADMAP

 

NETmundial is not a stand-alone event and it will not finalize decisions  It is rather the starting point of a process to foster convergence of visions and ultimately produce an improved institutional framework  This is particularly true for the important third track topic (governance ON the Internet) 

 

It is useful here to remember that any development of policy or institution goes through three stages  issue-framing to define shared objectives; an iterative process to develop a draft framework; and ultimate validation by the relevant stakeholders  either through formal agreement or voluntary adhesion  The post-Sao Paulo roadmap could be built on these three stages   

 

The Internet & Jurisdiction Project is facilitating since 2012 a global multi-stakeholder dialogue process on a limited but cross-cutting issue  the development of a due process framework for transborder requests regarding domain name seizures  content takedowns and access to user data  Based on this experience  the facilitation team would like to propose here  in their personal capacity  three methodological questions that  if discussed at NETmundial  could help define the next steps in a roadmap 

 

a) What high-level common objective 

 

Discussions in Sao Paulo in the sessions dedicated to the roadmap will naturally reveal a diversity of proposals regarding the ultimate objective and potential institutional architectures to  further evolve the multistakeholder Internet governance ecosystem  

 

A key ambition of NETmundial should however be to identify a common formulation defining a high-level overarching objective acceptable by all participants  This is necessary to open the subsequent discussion of the various options under at least a common aspiration    

 

Operational questions are 

    How to document discussions in Sao Paulo in a synthetic manner to identify the areas of convergence and the various options 

    How and by whom should such a synthesis be prepared during (or after) the meeting 

 

b) What process to develop a recommendation 

 

The international agenda is already dense and numerous events gather the different stakeholders in various formats  However  a series of independent events is not sufficient to develop such a comprehensive institutional reform  A bounded in time  transparent and inclusive dialogue process allowing all categories of stakeholders to participate is most probably needed 

 

In this perspective  NETmundial could discuss the following operational questions   

    Which combination of actors can/should initiate such a dialogue process 

    Who can participate and how 

    Who can provide a neutral support function 

    How can existing meetings be leveraged 

 

c) How to validate the results of the process 

 

Irrespective of the ultimate framework proposal that the dialogue process would produce  it would require endorsement by a general consensus of actors  or at least a critical mass of them  to be implementable 

 

It is too early to discuss how formal such an endorsement would need to be  The discussions at NETmundial should therefore focus on setting the timeframe for such a process and the venue where it could be finalized 

 

5  POSSIBLE ROADMAP MILESTONES  

 

In this contribution  we argued that there are several tracks towards the further evolution of the multi-stakeholder Internet governance ecosystem  We highlighted in particular the importance of Track 3  i e  the development of a framework for the governance ON the Internet and the need for a dedicated dialogue process to do it 

 

Numerous discussions indicate a growing consensus towards setting 2015 as the target deadline for this discussion  The post-Sao Paulo roadmap should leverage existing milestone events to structure the work 

 

    The September 2014 IGF in Istanbul will be a natural moment to review the results of NETmundial after all stakeholders have had time to consult and discuss  It could thus catalyze agreement on how to organize the dialogue process to develop an improved ecosystem  The IGF consultations in May could decide to include dedicated workshops and a plenary session on that topic in the agenda 

    Great uncertainties remain on the format of the WSIS+10 review in 2015 and consultations are underway in that regard  But  whatever its format or location  this event appears as a potential natural target milestone for the end of the process 

    An open question is whether an additional event (NETmundial 2015 ) should - or not - be inserted in an already dense agenda of international meetings  in order to facilitate the discussions and the preparation of the WSIS+10 review

    Finally  many other events  including local and regional IGFs or conferences by existing international organizations  will naturally provide opportunities for further exchanges and outreach along the work of the dialogue process 

 

The discussions about the evolution of the Internet Governance ecosystem have reached an unprecedented level of international interest and the initiators of the NETmundial event should be thanked for providing the opportunity for serious discussions on this topic 

 

The time between NETmundial and the WSIS +10 constitutes a rare window of opportunity to build up a common governance framework that our increasingly connected societies need in the 21st century 

We hope this contribution will help participants in NETmundial map the way forward in an efficient and productive manner 

Registries (TLDs) 
entreprises of cognition
in the 21st century

1  Shocking regional disparities
Communication networks are intended to improve trade and living conditions for humans on
the entire planet  The Internet globalization can help provide unprecedented opportunities for
development and welfare but only if we preserve and promote cultural diversity  freedom
and human rights 
In this spirit  it is legitimate to compare  in each country  the investments in new TLDs to the
demographic weight of the country  This provides  for each country  a commitment rate in
the ICANN policy of new TLDs  Review of applications show that  
- The number of projected TLDs in South America (24) and Africa (17) are very low  while
the two continents are growing fast in the area of information and communication
technologies  Without a drastic rebalancing to their advantage  given the role of time in the
networks economy  these two continents are doomed to be consumers of dominant firms for
yet a decade at least 
- The analysis of the numbers of projects in North America (915) and Europe (671) reveals
that actually almost half of the so called European projects are managed by companies from
the United States  This brings down the number of truly European projects to 352  that is to
say  almost as Asia-Pacific (303)  The USA therefore total more than 1200 applications on
1930  that is nearly 2/3 of the investments in TLDs projects  Added to this are the technical
backend services for which 11 U S  companies cover 3/4 of the bids for TLDs 
The final distribution after selection between competitors for the same TLDs cannot
significantly reduce the domination of the US companies  This excessive domination is
dangerous because it can only generate withdrawals from the so called "One Net" and sow
animosity  It carries monoculture instead of diversity  Finally  it exposes the majority of the
users in the world to data collection and espionage in a questionable legal framework (USA
Patriot Act  FISA Amendments Act of 2008 etc )
2  Tax evasion on a large scale
All the TLDs projects of U S  companies in Europe are located in areas well known as "tax
havens"  European micro-States (152) and the British Caribbean Islands (167) 
European areas of low taxation  well known to allow sophisticated tax evading organizations 
as the Netherlands  Ireland and Switzerland  have attracted a higher proportion of
European projects that other European states having average or strong tax levels 
In the United States  a large proportion of projects are established in the State of Delaware  at
the expense of the population of the United States 
This systematic tax avoidance is possible because of legal facility offered to establish a
business in a country but to choose another country as the place for tax 

The above table is attached as a file named TLD_Mundo pdf
3  Issues of global public interest
Practices of tax evasion on a large scale will remain possible as long as there will remain at
least ONE complacent micro-state and that it will be lawful to separate place of business and

fiscal establishment  It is much easy for registries as they don't require significant physical
installations 
More importantly perhaps is the moral factor  the psychological one  The naming operators
are readily hostile to states  anti-parliamentary and deeply suspicious of the political class 
Fiscal forcing solutions could be ineffective 
Public officials as well as private entrepreneurs cannot ignore the risks facing the planet and
human populations  The Naming and Internet ecosystem cannot evolve in a bubble 
sheltered from global risks and ignoring them  global warming  environmental degradation
critical inevitable migration  growth of cities  overcrowding with lacking education and
health  explosive growth of inequalities etc 
4  Apparently conflicting approaches may converge
Respecting the different sensitivities  it seems possible to make converge within the
ecosystem of naming  conventional approaches to public policy with liberal
philanthropic initiatives  Designating common goals can enable very heterogeneous entities
to work in the same direction 
In economic terms  the tax evasion practices distort competition since many 'normal'
companies  usually small and medium enterprises  do not seek to evade taxes and contribute
to the collective efforts of their compatriots 
In line with the Public Interest Commitments (PIC) introduced by ICANN in the management
of applications for new TLDs  it could be introduced a policy of social and environmental
responsibility  Each registry residing in an area where the tax is lower than the global
average would face an alternative  
- Either to withdraw its declaration of tax residence and return to its real country of
establishment 
- Either to exercise its social and environmental responsibility by a financial contribution to
projects of global public interest  without going through a national taxation 
5  A Sustainable Responsible Business Committee (SRBC)
The rules for calculating minimum contributions could be determined annually by an
independent commission called for example Sustainable Responsible Business Committee
(SRBC)   
Companies would be free to contribute beyond the amount calculated by the SRBC  And
other businesses already taxed in their respective countries could also participate  if they wish 
on a purely voluntary basis  A global hall of fame of the contributors would be published
and maintained  Attendance on this list could become for companies a communication
argument and this could create a virtuous circle 
The global average used as a reference could be the average tax within countries hosting
registries  weighted by the number of registries 
6  Make actors of the ecosystem become entrepreneurs of cognition in the 21st century

Financial contributions collected by the SRBC would be allocated to priority projects  Their
list would be established and maintained by the SRBC  Companies could affect their
contributions to projects of their choice among three categories 
- Rebalancing the global distribution of TLDs 
- Basic training in computing for young children worldwide 
- Visualization of data on major global issues 
So companies of the naming ecosystem could play a full role of cognition companies in the
21st century

Evolution and Internationalization of ICANN 

CGI br - Brazilian Internet Steering Committee  (Note 1)

Summary

 

The Brazilian Internet Steering Committee (CGI br) understands that ICANN s evolution shall be guided by these main tenets  (1) the organization has to be fully internationalized and it has to develop a proper framework for both vertical and horizontal accountability; and (2) ICANN's institutional evolution shall seek a better equilibrium among all stakeholders  as well as among the different countries  Instead of listing a set of specific proposals  this document highlights some objectives to be pursued after the NetMundial meeting and posits some requirements to be observed and some questions to be asked in the course of that quest  It bears on the assumption that ICANN should be the responsible institution within the Internet governance ecosystem for the assignment of names and numbers  including the full spectrum of the IANA functions  CGI br understands that the maintenance of ICANN as a focal point for those activities is the best alternative for the assurance of a unique and global Internet  for it has the established technical capacity and the policy-making mechanisms that can keep the Internet running without compromising its availability in the furtherance of current global Internet governance discussion fora  such as NetMundial and IGF  It does not mean that ICANN s operation and its governance system are to remain unchallenged  It simply means that it is better to count on a fully established system to be enhanced than to start a whole system from scratch 

 

1  The role for an internationalized ICANN

 

CGI br supports the measures that have been taken in regard to ICANN's internationalization  but understands that so far they have been focused mainly on the operational level of its mandate (Note 2)  Far more important than those efforts is placing ICANN under a new international legal-institutional framework that replaces the current contract (the Affirmation of Commitments) with the USA government and removes ICANN's direct or indirect subordination to the US legal system (Note 3)  In realistic terms  this goal may be achieved within a 5 to 10 years time frame  following a sequence of steps that are still to be devised  following a roadmap for the international Internet governance ecosystem that is expected as one of the outcomes of multistakeholder fora like NetMundial  IGF  and others 

 

One of the main IANA functions is the global coordination of the allocation and registration of IP addresses  ICANN is still legally responsible for this function  but its practical execution is completely decentralized by the global structure of five different Regional Internet Registries (RIRs)  These RIRs have in turn created a coordination forum - the Number Resource Organization (NRO)  The RIRs and the NRO coordinate the process of distribution of IPv4 and IPv6 blocks  also taking into account a well designed and consensual strategy for the transition of the number resources  CGI br strongly believes that this is a very good example of how other IANA functions can be decentralized and delegated  without removing the overall institutional responsibility of ICANN over those functions  It also serves as a very suitable model for the internationalization of IANA functions 

 

The sound solution for the internationalization of ICANN - considering that it should keep all its current responsibilities - has to encompass the discussion of adequate solutions for the effective internationalization of all IANA functions (not only the allocation and registration of IP addresses)  In the search of an adequate legal and institutional framework that replaces the current contract with the US government  it will be extremely relevant to decide which entity  or set of entities  will be made responsible for the management of the root zone file  such as to guarantee its stability  security  and reliability  An adequate direction for that matter can be the assignment of this task to a set of international entities (in a way similar to the RIRs/NRO structure for IP allocation) that are already responsible for other aspects of the Internet governance  that operate in a well-balanced multistakeholder model  and that bear the required technical qualifications 

 

A third aspect of the evolution of ICANN towards its internationalization is its accountability  ICANN is currently accountable to the US government  according to the goals and mechanisms that are established by the AoC  In theoretical terms  those present to the NetMundial meeting shall bear in mind the fact that there are different sorts of accountability that depend mostly on the nature of the relations and of the interest of the actors in a specific institutional setting (Note 4)  Within democratic political institutions  for instance  vertical and horizontal accountability are two different components of overall accountability (Note 5)  Vertical accountability means that each specific organ within the ICANN chart has to be fully accountable to its direct constituents  Horizontal accountability means that  within the ICANN system  every single organ has to be fully accountable to all others as well  And all of the system has to be fully accountable to Internet users in general  in a reliable  open and transparent  and timely manner  How can ICANN  in an international legal and institutional framework different from the AoC and from the current bylaws that guide the corporation  be accountable to the public interest  represented by all end users of the Internet  in a way that is consistent with universally accepted principles of use and governance of the Internet which respect fundamental human rights and promote social  economic  and cultural progress of citizens of all countries 

 

An adequate roadmap for the evolution of the global Internet governance ecosystem  together with a roadmap for the internationalization of ICANN  must firstly look for this set of principles for the use and governance of the Internet  from which the definition of accountability mechanisms for ICANN will be possible  In a certain way  the set of stakeholder groups that are present in ICANN also represents the international public interest  expressed by a set of principles for use and governance of the Internet - or  with the appropriate improvements in the structure and operation of ICANN  they may be able to represent this public interest  A possible way for improving the accountability of ICANN is to assign the oversight responsibility within the new institutional setting to be proposed as an outcome of NetMundial to already existent stakeholder groups within the ICANN system  Another approach would be the assignment of that oversight to entities outside ICANN  as long as they are recognized as representative of the international public interest  A clear advantage of this second approach is the avoidance of an overlapping reality  in which the organization responsible for policy making is also responsible for the oversight of policy implementation 

 

2  Leveling the playfield among stakeholders and countries

 

In a paper presented at the 8th Annual GigaNet Symposium  Laura DeNardis and Mark Raymond classified multistakeholderism according to the type of stakeholders involved (States  firms  non-governmental organizations  and/or international organizations) and the nature of authority relations enshrined within a specific political community (hierarchical  polyarchic  or anarchic)  The matrix derived from those two variables yields thirty three different forms of multistakeholderism (Note 6)  CGI br has its own model of governance - recognized as a best practice within several different fora  including the Internet Governance Forum and ICANN itself  It has successfully created a decalogue of fundamental principles for the use and governance of the Internet in Brazil  Both CGI br's governance model and its decalogue can inform the way forward for the global governance of the Internet  not only because they represent the commitment of all stakeholders involved  but also because it expressly deals with cultural and socio-economic developmental issues that can serve the purposes and interests of developing and the least developed countries in global governance at large (Note 7) 

 

A first step on that direction shall be the establishment of a serious and permanent discussion about the appropriate contours of multistakeholderism for Internet governance in the 21st Century  Bearing in mind the study conducted by DeNardis and Raymond  CGI br believes that the best model comprises all of the relevant actors within their scope of action and is polyarchic in form (the one in which authority is neither centralized within a single entity nor inexistent) 

 

Despite being polyarchic in nature  ICANN multistakeholder governance sometimes can tilt between anarchy (in which economic and political power outside institutional constraints is the enforcing mechanism) and hierarchy (in which the Board or the GAC  for instance  imposes restrictions on the action of other stakeholders)  In light of that abstract reality  analyses of the structure and operation of ICANN have revealed various problems regarding an inadequate balance among the various stakeholder groups  Examples of problems are  the inadequacy of the mechanism for governments  participation via the GAC; the very small influence of civil society upon the final decisions of the GNSO and the Board; and the capture of ICANN by the domain industry (both registries and registrars)  To these problems we must add the lack of balance among different countries  whereby developing countries (both their governments and representatives of their civil societies and private sectors) have a very small influence on the policy cycle  The current structure of ICANN  including the Board  the SOs and the ACs  with their respective roles  and in particular the daily operation of these bodies  do not seem to achieve an adequate balance among all stakeholder groups and among all countries (Note 8) 

 

Although the improvements regarding transparency and accountability suggested by the ATRT 1  and revised and enhanced by the ATRT 2  go in the right direction  they lack enough generality  since they basically reflect priorities and conditions expressed by the AoC  A revision of those recommendations under a much more general framework could bring important enhancements to the structure and operation of ICANN  

 

In the following  we suggest some specific paths to be followed  This is merely illustrative and shall be taken as a point of departure for further discussions 

 

    Even if the GAC keeps its role as an advisory body to the Board  government representatives should participate effectively in the policy development processes in the GNSO  Governments' influence on those policies only when they are being considered by the Board for final deliberation should be avoided  as it represents an unduly advantage over other stakeholder groups 
    The weight of registries and registrars in the policy development processes should be reduced  The current structure of  houses  in the GNSO gives them the same weight as all other stakeholder groups together  while  in fact  those other groups represent the interests of all other sectors of the society and are thus better placed to represent the public interest 
    The structure and the role of the ALAC should be revised  since there is a clear redundancy among the ALAC and stakeholder groups in the GNSO; also the ALAC does not take part in the policy development processes in the GNSO  If the ALAC is meant to represent  in theory  the interests of all Internet users  who should be considered as very important stakeholders (maybe even the most important ones)  this seems highly contradictory  Besides  the participation of individuals and entities in the ALAC neither follows transparent rules nor guarantees an adequate global representation of users 
    The composition of the Board should be revised in order to reflect a better balance among stakeholder groups  considering the ultimate goals of ICANN  which should be materialized by a set of principles adopted by the organization for the use and governance of the Internet  In particular  in order to reinforce its multistakeholder nature  the number of Board seats allocated by the NomCom could be reduced  thus increasing the slots for Board members directly elected by the SOs 
    Sufficient funds should be provided to promote and ensure the participation of individuals representing stakeholder groups from developing countries  Mechanisms should be implemented to ensure their effective participation in the different organizations  committees  and working groups of ICANN 
    Once an adequate and balanced participation of all stakeholder groups (including governments) and all countries in the policy development processes in the GNSO is ensured  the role of the Board regarding the final approval of those policies should be revised  The Board should have only an oversight role over those processes  in a way to guarantee that they follow the adequate balance among all stakeholder groups and that the public interest has been served  The guidance for the Board shall derive from the overarching set of principles for the use and governance of the Internet to which ICANN should be committed  Also the Board accountability and transparency mechanisms should be improved  in such a way that the global society is able to check that the actions of the Board are consistent with the safeguard of those principles

Internet Governance Initiatives  Towards Enhancing Multi-stakeholderism For All
Abstract
Internet governance literature emphasizes the importance of multi-stakeholderism  However  it is unclear how this can be achieved in regions lacking developed stakeholder groups or stakeholder groups independent of state authority  This is a challenge that reaches many countries  including small island states  It is an opportunity that should be recognized  and supported in Internet Governance initiatives  This proposal highlights the role of Internet governance and capacity building initiatives in empowering the growth of informed multi stakeholder groups in such regions as well as empowering individuals to take part in multi-stakeholder processes 
As NETMundial Conference is discussing principles  and evolution of the Internet Governance Ecosystem  sensitivities that recognize the unique situation of certain countries in the evolution and emergence of stakeholders should be taken into account 
Persian IGF Background 
The Persian Internet Governance Forum (PersianIGF) was launched by IJMA3 and Tehran ICT Guild (TIG) in 2013  Its purpose is to provide a multi-stakeholder venue where different stakeholder groups discuss and exchange information  viewpoints and ideas about current and emerging Internet governance issues  PersianIGF is a thematic forum and strives to reach out to the Persian speaking community in Afghanistan  Iran and Tajikistan as well as the Persian speaking diaspora in other countries 
Roadmap for the Further Evolution of the Internet Governance Ecosystem
Internet governance literature advocates the use of a multi-stakeholder model  It is one of the main means for maintaining an open Internet which facilitates social  cultural  and economic development  However  multi-stakeholderism is in its infancy especially in developing countries  Many developing countries striving to democratize their processes have established state-centric approaches  The existence of different stakeholders may be in various stages of evolution in many countries  Introducing new models of governance may need discussion and examination to create understanding and awareness 
In such regions  civil society and other non-state actors  including business  NGOs  etc  may be just emerging  or simply yet to make their interest in articipation in a multi-stakeholder process known  This creates unique challenges that must start with awareness and outreach  Care should be taken to enable weak and fragile stakeholder groups to contribute to global collaboration on Internet governance decision making  In the absence of such stakeholder groups  representative expert individuals should be afforded the opportunity to participate in the Internet governance process 
Capacity building programs  regional  national and thematic Internet governance initiatives can help with enhancing the experts  and stakeholder groups  abilities to participate in these processes  Just as the Internet connects the world  such initiatives connect truly global constituencies to the important work of Internet governance  Their voices are important but it is the responsibility of the wider multi-stakeholder community to help them become engaged  and supported in participation 
Enhancing the voice of new and emerging stakeholder groups and individuals in Internet governance especially helps developing countries to participate in and benefit from economic and social opportunities that the Internet provides  The Internet is a means for social change and economic growth and the multi-stakeholder Internet governance is a key tool for its realization 
Multi-stakeholders governance cannot be truly implemented when the stakeholder groups representation criteria is vague  This would lead to weakening the regional and national actors and create a power imbalance
 
Evolution of new participants in stakeholder groups 
Flexible procedural mechanisms that can identify the stakeholder groups and their representatives and bring onboard new participants should continue to be a core activity to strengthen the IGF  Awareness of the need to create and support such mechanisms will benefit the IGF  and also different regional and national Internet governance initiatives  The procedures however should be flexible to preserve the evolution of stakeholder groups and Internet governance and maintain its inclusiveness 
Some of the core characteristics of the procedures are as follows 
The stakeholder groups are divided into governments  private sector  academics  technical community  civil society and international organizations  1 While this has been an accepted categorization it can also limit diversity and equal participation in Internet governance process  When a stakeholder group is weak in certain region the more flexible procedures could address this issue by recognizing the limitations and looking for other existing actors that Internet governance have an impact on their social and economic development  This may also lead to the evolution of the broadening of the general categorization of stakeholder groups 
  Procedural mechanisms that are implemented in global Internet governance initiatives should address the issue of power imbalance between national  regional and international stakeholder groups  representatives  The procedures should truly give the stage to all the actors equally  This is especially important for the regional and national private actors and civil society actors in developing countries that may have less access to resources in order to take part in the process 
  Allowing expert individuals to take part in the process without having to select a stakeholder group may represent an innovation that should be piloted in the upcoming IGF in Turkey  but also may be welcomed in national and regional IGF initiatives  This in the long term may result in the evolution of stakeholder groups and also allows for those countries that cannot relate to the main categorization of the general stakeholder groups to participate in the process  Moreover  it prevents non-genuine affiliation of organizations and individuals to specific stakeholder groups or multiple stakeholder groups 
  The Internet governance initiatives and other entities should consider the best practices that are used in emerging countries for empowering different stakeholder groups 
 
Openness  Economic Development and Multi-Stakeholder Fora
1 TUNIS AGENDA FOR THE INFORMATION SOCIETY  WSIS 05/TUNIS/DOC/6(Rev  1)-E  2005 
Maintaining an open  interconnected  and interoperable Internet is crucial for social  cultural  and economic development  Internet governance ecosystem should be able to efficiently maintain the openness of the Internet and consciously consider social and economic development as key goals  Strengthening the multistakeholder model in Internet governance eco system can support this  However  multi-stakeholder model should not only consider the global  regional and national Internet governance issues  but should also consider diverse viewpoints that cannot be categorized under the geographical indications  The openness of the Internet should not be a motto; concrete action plans should be drafted and implemented to achieve utmost openness of the Internet through a multi-stakeholder governance model 
For the upcoming NETMundial  the PersianIGF Initiative wishes to acknowledge the communication from the IGF MAG  that both noted the NETMundial Conference  and also supports welcoming inputs from the NETMundial Conference  along with other inputs  to report on and discuss their work at the IGF 2014 in Instanbul 
Thank you for this opportunity to provide inputs into the NETMundial Conference 

The process of expansion and rapid growth of the Internet use by the private sector  governments  civil society organizations and an increasing number of people has raised new issues and challenges related to the protection of the civil and political rights and to the Internet development and access  Since the early 2000s laws and policies have been proposed  in a disorganized matter and without a clear reference  which most of the times lacked of knowledge on Internet basic features and operation  By then it was already evident the need of fundamental principles to properly address technical and political disputes between all stakeholders and to guarantee Internet quality  reliability and security for multiple kinds of users  In this context  CGI br believed that it was crucial to establish essential and minimum standards to ensure  in the future  the free and open Internet use  as well as to allow continuous innovation  economic and political development  and the emergence of a culturally vibrant society 

 

In order to do so  in 2009 the Brazilian Internet Steering Committee (CGI br)  after a period of two years of intense debate  adopted a resolution entitled "The principles for the Internet governance and use" (Resolution CGI br / RES / 2009/003/P)  Recently  these principles  which were the result of a multistakeholder dialogue process and were approved by consensus among the representatives of the various sectors in the Committee  have inspired national legislation (e g  The Civil Rights Framework for the Internet) and have been subsidizing the debate on the need for Internet governance international principles  These principles are listed below  As we can see  they are sufficiently accurate and complete to enable Internet good governance 

 

1  Freedom  privacy and human rights The use of the Internet must be driven by the principles of freedom of expression  individual privacy and the respect for human rights  recognizing them as essential to the preservation of a fair and democratic society 

 

2  Democratic and collaborative governance Internet governance must be exercised in a transparent  multilateral and democratic manner  with the participation of the various sectors of society  thereby preserving and encouraging its character as a collective creation 

 

3  Universality Internet access must be universal so that it becomes a tool for human and social development  thereby contributing to the formation of an inclusive and nondiscriminatory society  for the benefit of all 

 

4  Diversity Cultural diversity must be respected and preserved and its expression must be stimulated  without the imposition of beliefs  customs or values 

 

5  Innovation Internet governance must promote the continuous development and widespread dissemination of new technologies and models for access and use 

 

6  Neutrality of the network Filtering or traffic privileges must meet ethical and technical criteria only  excluding any political  commercial  religious and cultural factors or any other form of discrimination or preferential treatment 

 

7  Unaccountability of the network All action taken against illicit activity on the network must be aimed at those directly responsible for such activities  and not at the means of access and transport  always upholding the fundamental principles of freedom  privacy and the respect for human rights 

 

8  Functionality  security and stability The stability  security and overall functionality of the network must be actively preserved through the adoption of technical measures that are consistent with international standards and encourage the adoption of best practices 

 

9  Standardization and interoperability The Internet must be based on open standards that facilitate interoperability and enable all to participate in its development 

 

10  Legal and regulatory environments The legal and regulatory environments must preserve the dynamics of the Internet as a space for collaboration

In addition to enhancing the dissemination of ideas and opinions and allowing for the creation and manifestation of diversity  Information and Communications Technologies also provide powerful tools for collecting  storing and processing personal data  Such tools can be used by both the private sector and the Government  and in both cases they must comply with strict standards on the protection of the fundamental right to privacy  Internationally  this right is provided for in article XII of the Declaration of Human Rights  which protects one from any arbitrary or illegal interference with its private life and assures the protection of law against such interferences and attacks  Similar provision is given under article 17 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights  among others  Different national and regional laws also include the right to privacy with more or less details  In Brazil  privacy protection is an indelible clause ( cláusula pétrea ) of the Brazilian Federal Constitution of 1988  covering the inviolability of the communications (articles 5  X and XII)  and is part of the Brazilian Internet Use and Governance Principles approved by CGI Br - Comitê Gestor da Internet no Brasil  (Brazilian Internet Steering Committee) in 2009 Its strict relation with the exercise of freedom of expression  with the access to the information and with the base principles of a democratic society was reaffirmed in the recent UN resolution  The Right to Privacy in the Digital Age   proposed by Brazil and Germany and supported by 55 co-sponsorsing countries Edward Snowden s denunciations of mass spying by the United States National Security Agency gave rise to a global general interest in the surveillance of citizens worldwide  Although PRISM-based programs and rules have been a reality for many years  such as the Echelon Program or the Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act (CALEA)  Snowden's episode is quite relevant for some reasons The first and most important of them is the opportunity that is opened for reviewing such practices in reply to the coordinated international reaction  The second one is the increased understanding that any reaction implies recognition of the global scale of the network  and therefore the international effort to set parameters and control mechanisms for surveillance  The third one consists of evidences that the fight against spying goes through telecommunication networks  different Internet layers  hardware and software The question  therefore  is how to protect the privacy and the personal data in this context The current international Internet governance ecosystem lacks a proper body with authority to discuss and coordinate solutions from the perspective of human rights protection  Multistakeholder spaces such as the Internet Governance Forum (IGF) or the UN Commission on Science and Technology for Development (CSTD) could be structured as bodies responsible for coordinating discussions and actions and entitled to make recommendations to other international bodies towards more effective privacy protection globally Given the current international law and human rights perspective  CGI br also considers that the definition of parameters for ensuring privacy of communications must be based on some fundamentals  - Initially  the principle of legality must be respected  i e   the need for clear and accurate legal provision for cases where communication surveillance is admitted must be ensured  These law provisions must confer such powers only upon authorization by the competent judicial authority and for a legitimate aim clearly delimited that serves to the protection of relevant legal interests required in democratic societies  Communications surveillance may not be established based on discrimination of race  color  religion  gender  language  nationality  social origins  political opinions  or other similar criteria - Such limitations to privacy in communications must be necessary  adequate and proportional considering the legitimate goals intended to be achieved   Necessary   because it must be the only means or the least offensive alternative to human rights able to effectively achieve the intended legitimate aim   Adequate  because it is necessary that it is proper to achieve this specific aim    Proportional   because it must always be considered that the practice of surveillance is harmful to the exercise of fundamental rights and to democracy  In such context  the adoption of these practices must entail the balancing of the seriousness involving the breach of privacy in relation to the legitimate aim intended to be achieved  with the establishment of measures and differentiated degrees of intrusion for criminal investigations and other investigations - The limitations to the right to privacy on communications must be determined by a competent and impartial judicial authority that is independent from other authorities that conduct the surveillance proceedings  Court order shall be issued in the due process  subject to the procedures provided for by law  publicly known and in line with the protection of human rights  Full legal defense cannot be excluded also  and user notification may be waived or postponed only in specific cases set forth by law- Transparency of the States in the use and scope of the techniques and powers related to communications surveillance is required  Periodic reports must give information about refused and approved requests  about what is the service provider that has received them and about the type of investigation  The applicable legislation and the procedures put in place by the service providers  regarding those requests  also must be publicly available  The practice of surveillance by the State must be under the supervision of other entities  The compliance of these measures  however  doesn t avoid the concern that the surveillance on communications may compromise the integrity  security and privacy of the communication system  - Finally  it is relevant to establish protection related to the international cooperation on the provision of data and against the illegitimate access to the information of users  In the first case  among others  it is important to assure international standards with high level of human rights protection by means of agreements clearly documented  publicly available  and subjected to the guarantees of procedural fairness  In the second case  it s necessary that countries are encouraged to consider on their legal systems the appropriated responsibility to improper usage and providing of data  as well as stipulate defense mechanisms to the individuals affected  The legal protection of privacy may also imply the guarantee of data destruction or its return to the individuals as soon as the material obtained through surveillance procedures has accomplished the purpose for which it has been collected 

 

These fundamentals are inspired by a proposal developed by different international civil society organizations and supported by more than 400 entities around the world  entitled  International Principles on the Application of Human Rights to Communications Surveillance  (available at https //en necessaryandproportionate org)

Background

 

When ICANN earnestly activated its new TLD issuance responsibilities in 2005  its initial inclination was to view cities as outside the scope of entities eligible for Top Level Domains  After a persuasive campaign by representatives from Berlin  Barcelona  New York  Paris  Tokyo and other global cities  that viewpoint changed and cities were included within ICANN s 2008 resolution authorizing a new TLD program 

 

As the ICANN community struggled through the long process of developing an Applicant Guidebook  many in the city-TLD community noted that the needs of cities and their probable use of TLDs differed in significant ways from those of generic and business TLDs  And they urged that a different set of requisites for city-TLDs be established  Additionally  these proponents urged that cities be forewarned about the implications of a TLD  enabling cities to better prepare for the responsibilities entailed in their planning and operation 

 

However  the challenges surrounding the completion of an Applicant Guidebook and pressure from eager applicants did not allow for applicant categories  And the only significant interventions  were those proffered by ICANN s Government Advisory Committee (GAC) on behalf of the integrity of geographic names 

 

As of March 2014 it seems likely that approximately 35 cities will receive TLDs in the coming year 

 

This submission advances two topics for consideration by NETmundial  The first involves changes to the city-TLD issuance and development process and for the inclusion of cities in Internet governance processes  The second suggests a means for cities and individual Internet users to better participate in Internet governance processes 

 

Cities and Top Level Domains

 

Cities are amongst the oldest and most complex entities we encounter in our daily lives  They house more than half our planet s population  with U N  estimates projecting that will rise to 75% by mid-century  Cities are the places from which a preponderance of ideas and economic development emerge  And there s growing acceptance that a sustainable planet is likely to arise from the efficiencies of urban areas 

 

To date  the digital needs of cities have been given short shrift by Internet technologists and the Net s governance ecology  As remedy  we offer the following suggestions 

 

    The Roadmap should recommend a more robust process for issuing city-TLDs  This should include a recommendation that the TLD issuing entity provide an informative and enlightening application process for cities considering TLD acquisition  While the  letter of non-objection   required of the 2012 city-TLD applicants held the spirit of informed consent  the inclusion of a detailed scoping of a city-TLDs utility to residents  local businesses  quality of life  government operation  and global identity would better contribute to their efficacious planning and development 

 

    Cities do not have a formal place in the Internet governance ecology  While a City-TLD Governance and Best Practices workshop was held at the 2010 IGF in Vilnius  follow-up has been scant  At ICANN  there s a move to include city-TLDs within the Registry Constituency of the GNSO  but only as part of a broader geographic representation  However  considering their size  their unique needs  and their importance to the global economy and a sustainable planet  we urge that cities be considered a full stakeholder within any multistakeholder regime 

 

A Message From The Bottom

 

Our lives are increasingly affected by digital activities enabled by the Internet  Yet Internet users have modest access to the  bottom-up  governance structures that establish the policies  standards  and practices that guide the Net s operation 

 

Here in New York City we ve experienced a small inkling of the potential of bottom-up participation in Internet oversight and management through two At-Large Structures  One is operated by the New York Internet Society  a chapter of the global Internet Society  and another by Connecting nyc Inc   an advocacy and education organization focused on the development of the  nyc TLD  For those not familiar with the role of the At-Large Structures within ICANN  here s a brief history 

 

In its early days ICANN provided for strong representation of individual Internet users in its decision making processes  It did so by allocating 5 seats on its board of directors to be filled by Internet users  with each of ICANN s regions selecting one member via a direct election  One such election was held and  for a time  5 ICANN board members were selected by individual Internet users 

 

The corporation found fault with the selection process and replaced the user-selected members with an appointed At-Large Advisory Committee and a Nominating Committee charged with selecting several board members 

 

In recent years the At-Large was reconstituted and now participates in selecting one (1) voting member to ICANN s board of directors  This member is selected via a multi-staged process that provides for each At-Large Structure (organizations with membership and other structures) casting a vote for its preferred board member 

 

While one board member is better than none  by any measure  under today s governance formation  the world s 2+ billion individual Internet users and the At-Large Structure s impact on ICANN s governance decisions remains tenuous 

 

In our role as an At-Large Structure Connecting nyc Inc  has observed a significant improvement of the At-Large s operation over the past several years  As one example  this past year the At-Large made significant contributions more than a dozen ICANN policy considerations 

 

But far more can be achieved by expanding and enhancing user engagement the through the following actions 

 

    The number of seats selected by individual Internet users on ICANN s board of directors should be increased  Reverting to the original 5 seats seems a reasonable short term target 

 

    The new board seats should be allocated as of old  one per ICANN region 

 

    The new seats should be selected by direct vote of each region s At-Large Structures  (There are currently 180 At-Large Structures in the 5 regions )

 

    The number of At-Large Structures should to be increased with additional resources provided to facilitate their operation 

 

    Care should be taken to assure that participation by the poor and the marginalized is facilitated 

 

    Concomitant with this resource allocation there needs to be improved transparency and accountability measures for the At-Large 

 

    In those instances where At-Large Structures exist in cities with TLDs  city government should be provided with ex officio participation 

 

For those interested in learning more about the At-Large  an At-Large Summit is to be held during ICANN s June 2014 London meeting  with a representative from each of the At-Large Structures in attendance 

 

If is our belief that engaging cities as stakeholders and expanding the At-Large will democratize and enhance the ICANN s operation 

 

-----

Connecting nyc Inc  is a New York State not-for-profit formed in 2006 to advocate and facilitate the development of the  nyc TLD as a public interest resource  In 2012 it was recognized as an At-Large Structure by ICANN   

The Council of Europe's 10 Internet Governance Principles were prepared and adopted by its 47 member states in 2010-2011  These principles are based on Europe's core values of human rights  rule of law and democracy  They provide the social  economic and human context for the Organisation's standard-setting  monitoring and cooperation activities in the field of Internet governance  Above all  they are baseline for the 47 member states national  European and international public policy regarding the Internet  

 

Several of the CoE principles can be found in the principles of several other organisations and bodies (such as the APC  IGF Dynamic Coalition on Internet rights and principles  GNI  OECD and ISOC)  including multi-stakeholder governance  global nature of the Internet  its open architecture and network neutrality  Certain of them have been developed further by the CoE  in particular member states commitment to "doing no harm" to the Internet's universality  integrity and openness of the Internet (see https //wcd coe int/ViewDoc jsp id=1835707) and on network neutrality (see  https //wcd coe int/ViewDoc jsp id=1678287) 

 

Everyone has the right to freedom of expression and access to information regardless of frontiers (Article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights)  and it is on this basis that the CoE is responding to many of the challenges about how the Internet is governed and by whom 

 

- governance "of" the Internet i e  its architecture and the cooperation between state and non-state actors to protect and preserve the (one) Internet as we know it 

 

- governance "on" the Internet i e  the legtimacy of state and non-state actors to shaping and deciding on public policy affecting the content and application layers of the Internet (e g  CoE's human rights guidelines on social networks and on search engines) 

 

The CoE's work reconciles the roles  responsibilities  sovereignty and legitimacy of various Internet actors with regard to their commitment and action to protecting everyone's human rights  It addresses the positive and negative commitments of actors to protect the Internet while  at the same time  while erring on the side of freedom and liberty that is the Internet's very nature  Progress can also been seen in certain judgments of the European Court of Human Rights including on freedom of expression  mass online surveillance  and on the right to privacy (see  http //www echr coe int/Documents/FS_New_technologies_ENG pdf) 

 

A mapping of the CoE's work on Internet governance can be found in its 2012-2015 strategy (see https //wcd coe int/ViewDoc jsp id=1919461) but more consolidation and address of certain issues  such as transparency and accountability as well as more positive obligations to help people access and participate in society  is needed in order to address these issues and arguable deficits  There is convergence between what the CoE's core values and Brazil's Marco Civil da Internet and it would be timely and appropriate to share  to exchange and even lead on aspects of NETmundial where necessary 

EBU position on net neutrality   on radio spectrum and on freedom of expression 

 

I NET NEUTRALITY

 

The EBU supports a strong regulatory framework for net neutrality  reflecting the fact that the openness and non-discriminatory features of the Internet are key drivers for innovation  economic efficiency and safeguarding media freedom and pluralism  Thus  EBU and its members require the introduction of net neutrality provisions in the future Internet Governance Principles  The EBU  

 

-Clearly recognizes that the open Internet is a key driver for innovation  economic efficiency but also for safeguarding media freedom and pluralism

 

-Clarify the definitions of an  Internet access service  and a  specialised service  in order to guarantee a dynamic co-existence between these different services

 

-Clarify the relationship between an  Internet access service  and a  specialised service   the open Internet should remain the norm  not become the exceptionand specialised (managed) services cannot be offered by ISPs at the expense of the development of the open public Internet

 

-Address the uncertainty regarding the rule on Assured Service Quality connectivity products

 

-Strengthen and simplify the rule according to which no blocking nor throttling of content on the Internet is allowed

 

-Improve transparency and facilitate monitoring by end-users

 

1 Recognize that the open Internet is a key driver for innovation  economic efficiency but also for safeguarding media freedom and pluralism

 

National regulatory authorities shall closely monitor and ensure the effective ability of end users to benefit the continued availability of non-discriminatory internet access services at levels of quality that reflect advances in technology and that are not impaired by specialised services  They shall  in cooperation with other competent national authorities  also monitor the effects of specialised services on cultural and linguistic diversity  media freedom and pluralism and innovation 

 

The openness and non-discriminatory features of the Internet are key drivers for innovation  economic efficiency as well as safeguarding media freedom and pluralism and cultural diversity 

 

    Clarify the definitions of an  Internet access service  and a  specialised service 

 

"internet access service" means a publicly available electronic communications service that provides connectivity to the internet  and thereby connectivity between virtually all end points connected to the internet  irrespective of the network technology used; It enables end-users to run any application utilising an electronic communications network based on the best effort principle;

 

 "specialised service" means an electronic communications service or any other service that provides the capability to access specific content  applications or services  or a combination thereof  and whose technical characteristics are controlled from end-to-end or provides the capability to send or receive data to or from a determined number of parties or endpoints  It is provided using the Internet Protocol and operated within closed electronic communications networks that rely on admission control  A specialised service is shall not be marketed or used as a substitute for internet access service;

 

 End-users shall also be free to agree with either providers of electronic communications to the public or with providers of content  applications and services on the provision of specialised services operated in closed electronic networks with an enhanced quality of service 

 

 Vertically integrated providers of electronic communications to the public shall not discriminate against traffic from providers of content  applications and services which provide contents  services  or applications competing with their own services or with services provided on the basis of exclusive arrangements   

 

 ISPs have clear incentives to engage in differentiation practices  Addressing the risk of anti-competitive arrangements and preventing new forms of traffic discrimination should stand out clearly in a provision aimed at safeguarding net neutrality  These risks are particularly high in case of vertically integrated companies  which have an obvious incentive to offer better access to their own content offers than those of others 

 

    Clarify the relationship between Internet access services and specialised services 

 

 EBU supports the principle that specialised services shall not impair Internet access services 

 

The best effort open Internet should not be undermined by the development of specialised services or traffic with a guaranteed quality of service  The open internet should remain the norm  not the exception 

 

The internet has developed over the past decades as an open platform for innovation with low access barriers for end-users  content and application providers and internet service providers 

 

There is a need for clarity in the relationship between an Internet access service and a specialised service  The open Internet should remain the norm  not become the exception   

 

    Address uncertainty regarding the Assured Service Quality (ASQ) connectivity product

 

 EBU wants to promote the availability of connectivity products with assured service quality (ASQ) that enable communication paths across network domains and across network borders both within and between States  IP interconnection agreements have developed so far without any significant regulatory intervention and that today s arrangements reflect thebest effort principle and have so far been crucial for the Internet s contribution to growth and innovation and for end-users to reach alldestinations on the Internet 

 

    Strengthen and simplify the ‘no blocking/no throttling  rule

 

 The EBU points out that end-users are currently already free to enter into agreements on data volumes and speeds with providers of Internet access services  And so suggests that

 

 Providers of internet access services shall not block  slow down  degrade or discriminate against specific content  applications or services  or specific classes thereof  except in cases where it is necessary to apply reasonable traffic management measures  Reasonable traffic management measures shall be transparent  non-discriminatory  proportionate and necessary to 

 

a) implement a legislative provision or a court order  or prevent or impede serious crimes;

 

b) preserve the integrity and security of the network  services provided via this network  and the end-users' terminals;

 

c) prevent the transmission of unsolicited communications to end-users who have given their prior consent to such restrictive measures;

 

d) minimise the effects of temporary or exceptional network congestion provided that equivalent types of traffic are treated equally 

 

 Reasonable traffic management shall only entail processing of data that is necessary and proportionate to achieve the purposes set out in this paragraph 

 

 Any blocking  slowing down or discriminatory practice against specific content  applications or services is not allowed except for the stated exceptions 

 

 Any price discrimination or discriminatory conditions on volumes and data rates against specific content  applications or services should be prohibited  Reasonable traffic management measures should be transparent  proportionate and non-discriminatory  Reasonable traffic management encompasses prevention or impediment of serious crimes  including voluntary actions of providers to prevent access to and distribution of child pornography  Minimising the effects of network congestion should be considered reasonable provided that network congestion occurs only temporarily or in exceptional circumstances 

 

Discrimination against specific content  applications or services can take various forms 

 

5  Improve transparency and facilitate monitoring by end-users  

 

EBU asks that providers of electronic communications to the public shall  save for offers which are individually negotiated  publish transparent  comparable  adequate and up-to-date information on 

 

e) internet access services  where offered  specifying the following  

 

actually available data speed for download and upload in the end-user's State of residence  including at peak-hours; and the means for end-users to monitor at any moment the current available data speed for download and upload and a breakout of the actual delivered data speed during the contractual period;

 

Speeds and traffic shaping should be verifiable and measurable for end-users  

 

II             SPECTRUM

 

    Recognize the role of spectrum for radio and TV broadcasting as well as States  competence to safeguard cultural diversity and media pluralism

 

The EBU suggests that the Internet Governance rules will take in account the need to use the radio electric spectrum primarily for public interest and in particular request to 

 

-       Recognise the role of spectrum for radio and TV broadcasting as well as Member states  competence to safeguard cultural diversity and media pluralism

 

-       Take existing use of spectrum as well as the costs of vacating spectrum into account

 

-       Address potential interference issues

 

Radio spectrum is a public good and an essential resource for sectors and services including mobile  wireless broadband  satellite communications and TV and radio broadcasting  Development of wireless broadband communications contributes to the aim of securing access to broadband for all citizens and of providing citizens with the highest possible broadband speed and capacity 

 

Currently  Digital Terrestrial Television (DTT) is the most popular means of receiving TV in the world  Its value must be referenced  So EBU requests to organise and use radio spectrum for public order  public security  defence purposes and to pursue general interest objectives  in particular with regard to audiovisual and media policies 

 

In particular suggests to take account particular general interest objectives such as cultural diversity and media pluralism still apply 

 

    Clarify the notion of  harmonised spectrum 

 

"harmonised radio spectrum for wireless broadband communications" means radio spectrum for which the conditions of availability   efficiency and primary use serves for electronic communications services other than broadcasting;

 

The decision to allocate or harmonise radio spectrum is a political decision  so it has to guarantee that certain general interest objectives such as cultural diversity and media pluralism are taken into account 

 

Coordination and consistency of rights of use for radio spectrum should be improved   for the bands which have been harmonised for wireless fixed  nomadic and mobile broadband communications  This includes the bands identified at ITU level for International Mobile Telecommunications (IMT) Advanced systems  as well as bands used for radio local area networks (RLAN) such as 2 4 GHz and 5 GHz  It could also extend to bands harmonised in the future for wireless broadband communications

 

    Take existing users of spectrum as well as the costs of vacating spectrum into account

 

When determining the amount and type of radio spectrum to be assigned in a given procedure for granting rights of use for radio spectrum  the national competent authorities shall have regard to the following 

 

(a) the technical characteristics and the current and planned use of different available radio spectrum bands 

 

(b) the efficient use of the bands already granted to wireless broadband communications;

 

(c) the nature of market demand justifying the assignment of additional spectrum for wireless broadband communications

 

2  When determining whether to specify any minimum or maximum amount of radio spectrum  which would be defined in respect of a right of use in a given band or in a combination of complementary bands  national competent authorities shall ensure 

 

(a) the most efficient use of the radio spectrum  taking into account the characteristics and the current and planned use of the band or bands concerned;

 

3  National competent authorities shall ensure that the fees for rights of use for radio spectrum  if any 

 

(a) appropriately reflect the social  cultural and economic value of the radio spectrum  including beneficial externalities;

 

(b) take account of costs of vacating existing users of the radio spectrum  if any;

 

(c) avoid under-utilisation and foster investment in the capacity  coverage and quality of networks and services;

 

(d) avoid discrimination and ensure equality of opportunity between operators  including between existing and potential operators;

 

EBU stress the fact that existing users of the radio spectrum needs have to be taken in account  while  very often  national authorities don t consider the current use of spectrum before it is allocated/harmonised for wireless broadband 

 

This has an impact on the costs of vacating spectrum and on a new interference situation which needs to be handled  There is no obligation imposed when defining the spectrum requirements in terms of the amount of radio spectrum to be assigned  Regulators should  for example  ensure that the spectrum already allocated to mobile services is used in an efficient way 

 

Finally  it is important to also take into account the nature of actual market demand justifying the assignment of additional spectrum for wireless broadband communications  It cannot be assumed that more spectrum for wireless broadband is always the right answer to the need for more connectivity  For example  most media services are used indoors and it is more efficient to provide indoor coverage by means of fixed broadband combined with WiFi than by mobile networks  even though the services may be used on mobile and portable devices  such as smartphones and tablets  

 

    Address potential interference issues

 

Very often national governments fail to adequately address situations where potential interference between different spectrum users may occur  So EBU suggests requiring national competent authorities for radio spectrum to take account of potential interference issues as a regulatory principle when establishing authorisation conditions and procedures for rights of use for radio spectrum  And so EBU requests that future global regulation will be able to prevent any harmful interference  including the possibility to impose obligations to solve cases of interference with other users of the radio spectrum and to cover the costs incurred 

 

III            Freedom of expression includes the right of world citizens to access contents in their own language and relevant for their own culture 

 

"To promote a diverse media landscape that recognises the distinctive contribution to democracy by all three tiers of broadcasters – public service  community and commercial; to transform state and government media into public service media outlets with guarantees for full independence; including inserting this principle in the constitutions of societies in democratic transition"

 

Media freedom and diversity of contents  which are essential elements of any democratic society  are both values embedded in the mission of the Public Service Broadcasting  One of the very purposes of the PSB is defined as being to contribute  in the field of broadcasting  to "enhancing the freedom and pluralism of the media  the free flow of information and ideas  and the free formation of opinions" 

 

For these reasons EBU strongly supports the immediate adoption in all countries in transition to democracy by their Constitutional Assembly of the principle of protecting media freedom and public service at Constitutional level 

 

In this contest journalist safety plays an essential role in freedom of media and EBU fully support UNESCO pledge 

 

"To continue to combat impunity  particularly by implementing the UN inter-agency Plan of Action on The Safety of Journalists and the Issue of Impunity; To continue to request States to report on the status of investigation of cases of violence against media personnel and others contributing to public interest journalism  and ensure the transparency of this reporting"


Contribution from the ICANN Cross Community Working
Group on Internet Governance
Part I  Introduction
The ICANN Cross Community Working Group (CCWG) on Internet Governance drafted
this contribution using multistakeholder principles  The CCWG is an ad-hoc group
comprised of members of ICANN s Supporting Organisations (Address Supporting
Organisation - ASO; Country Code Domain Name Supporting Organization - ccNSO;
Generic Names Supporting Organization - GNSO) and Advisory Committees (At-Large
Advisory Committee - ALAC; Governmental Advisory Committee - GAC; and Security
and Stability Advisory Committee - SSAC) as well as GNSO Stakeholder Groups and
constituencies  This bottom-up process involved up to five people from each of these
groups that comprise ICANN s volunteer community  The concepts expressed in this
paper resulted from discussion on the CCWG s mailing list  input provided through the
CCWG Wiki space 1 and weekly conference calls from January - March 2014 
Due to time pressures  the proposals expressed in this contribution have not yet been
reviewed by the respective SOs  ACs and SGs of ICANN  They are therefore the
opinions solely of the authors  Further communication will advise the NetMundial
Organizing Committee if such ratification occurs before the meeting in Brazil 
As the CCWG is commenting on ICANN  and on ICANN's role within the larger Internet
Governance Ecosystem in preparation for a contribution to the NETMundial
Conference  these comments should be viewed as preliminary and focused on the
entities within the IG Ecosystem that we have been able to consider in the short
timeframe for preparing this submission  It is possible that further collaboration may
lead to changes and enhancements to the CCWG views 
Part II  Internet Principles
Declarations
2 1 The ICANN multistakeholder  bottom-up  consensus-based model best serves
the Internet community 
A multistakeholder model allows all stakeholders – whether individual citizens 
businesses  Internet Service Providers  intellectual property owners  governments

Meeting+in+Brazil+Home
intergovernmental institutions  registrars and registries  civil society organizations  or
technical experts – to have a say in shaping the future of Internet governance 
Because all members of the Internet community are affected by Internet governance 
we should all contribute to its development  Moreover  the multistakeholder model has
enabled and fostered the astonishingly rapid growth of the Internet as a critical platform
for innovation  creativity  commerce  and the exchange of information and ideas  If we
continue to refine and improve the multistakeholder model  we will ensure that the
Internet continues to grow and flourish in the future  Again  within the multistakeholder
model different stakeholders will take the lead on particular matters based on their
competency and mandate  but transparency and dialogue are key to the success of
multistakeholder processes 
Within ICANN  the multistakeholder model works in a bottom-up  consensus-based and
inclusive manner that lets every participant be heard and taken into consideration in the
decision-making process  Most initiatives emerge in the communities of stakeholders
and the ICANN Advisory Committees and are supported by ICANN staff  The public
comment process plays a very important role for this model  not only because it gives
transparency to the work done by the different communities and stakeholder groups 
but because it provides the essential feedback loop that is key to bottom-up 
consensus-based  multistakeholder governance 
ICANN has continuously improved its multistakeholder model and should continue to do
so  There should be no barriers for participation and outreach efforts should continue to
include under-represented groups 
Numerous other multistakeholder mechanisms exist  We offer two examples below 
The Regional Internet Registries (RIRs) also use a multistakeholder model to manage 
distribute and register Internet resources within their respective regions  There are five
RIRs 
  AFRINIC   Providing services in Africa
  APNIC   Providing services in Asia Pacific
  ARIN   Providing services in North America and the Caribbean
  LACNIC   Providing services in Latin America and the Caribbean
  RIPE NCC   Providing services in Europe  the Middle East and parts of Central
Asia
RIR Communities develop the policies for how resources should be delegated within
their respective regions  The RIR Policy Development Processes are documented and
are openly accessible by everyone  All policies  as well as the discussions that led to
their developments  are documented and archived in the respective RIR web pages  In
order to carry out their work  RIRs also support and work with technical communities
that understand infrastructure issues first hand 
The Internet Governance Forum (IGF) also exemplifies multistakeholder collaboration 
It was created to be a space for policy dialogue  where participants from all stakeholder
groups engage on an equal footing and have an equal opportunity to express
themselves  The IGF mandate encompasses  among other things  facilitating the
exchange of information and best practices  discussing public policy issues and
dialogue among bodies and actors dealing with Internet governance  strengthening and
enhancing the engagement of stakeholders  and contributing to capacity building  The
creation of the IGF was important to the development of the Internet governance model 
as it contributed to breaking down the silos among stakeholder groups  to the
emergence of a common language and common terms that facilitated understanding 
and to the identification of best practices that inspired concrete action at the regional
and at national levels 
2 2 The CCWG supports an Internet with a single root 
A single root is needed to ensure global uniqueness regarding names in the namespace
created by the delegated administration and allocation of unique names  Proposals by
certain other organisations contemplate the possibility of shared or multiple roots  The
CCWG believes that only a single root will guarantee global uniqueness and deter
fragmentation of the Internet 
2 3 The CCWG supports a unique Internet 
The Internet is made up of hundreds of thousands of networks  These networks
connect to each other thanks to a globally unique IP address space  Without this  the
Internet would be fragmented  Only parties connected to the same IP based network
with a globally unique IP address space can communicate with each other 
2 4 The CCWG supports best practices that enhance Internet security 
We support best practices that improve Internet security  For example  Domain Name
System SECurity (DNSSEC) makes it possible for a person receiving a response from a
DNS query to validate that the response is authoritative and that the signed data has
not been changed during transport  However  these policies should be developed in a
multistakeholder context with adequate input from all stakeholders  especially the
technical experts  the business community and civil society  each of which play a key
role in development and implementation of these best practices  Moreover  the
participation of all stakeholders is important to ensure that measures designed to
protect the security  stability  resiliency  and interoperability of the Internet do not get
overly politicized 
2 5 The CCWG supports transparency in Internet governance discussions 
The CCWG supports transparency in Internet governance discussions  All discussions
on aspects of Internet governance should be supported by full  inclusive and
transparent consultation with all affected stakeholders 
Part III  Future Evolution of the Internet Governance Ecosystem
Roadmap Contributions
3 1 Evolution of ICANN  principles by which ICANN should evolve 
ICANN plays a key role in keeping the Internet operational  by managing globally
unique identifiers  The Internet is a trans-border and shared resource  and ICANN
should contribute to its stability  robustness and interoperability  acting in a way that is
consistent with the common good  This means that ICANN should carry out its
stewardship role  caring more for the good management  use and evolution of this
shared resource than for any individual stake in it  (CERF at al   2014) 
ICANN is deeply connected to the web of relationships among institutions and actors
that are part of the Internet governance ecosystem  The functions it performs are
fundamental to the work carried out by other organizations and  ultimately  to keeping
the Internet running  This is a great responsibility and ICANN is constantly striving to
improve its governance model to better carry out its mission  The recent launch of the
Strategy Panels -- on ICANN Multistakeholder Innovation; on ICANN s role in the
Internet Organizations  Ecosystem; on the Public Responsibility Framework; and on
Identifier Technology Innovation -- demonstrate these efforts  as do the accountability
and transparency reviews  ICANN seeks to keep evolving together with the Internet
governance ecosystem 
In order to ensure that this evolution happens in the best possible manner  some
general principles need to be observed 
  Evolution must be driven by the ICANN Community  ICANN has a unique
multistakeholder model and a bottom-up process of decision-making  The
evolution of the organization must be based on input from the community 
ICANN s board should perform its tasks in ongoing consultation with the
community 
  Evolution should support the participation of a broader range of actors from all
sectors  especially those from developing regions 
  Transparency and accountability are key to all actions by the ICANN Board 
ICANN Staff  and the ICANN community 
  Globalization plans for ICANN must be developed with stakeholder support and
take into account impact on stakeholders 
  Negotiations with the US Department of Commerce on the future of ICANN
should take into account input received from the community 
3 2 Evolution of ICANN  Globalization of ICANN
Non-governmental administration of the DNS has been a long-standing goal that has
not yet been fully realized  Since 1999  ICANN has been a contractor with the United
States government for performing the IANA functions  while the National
Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) is tasked with the function
of  administrator  under this contract  Although important steps towards increasing
ICANN s independence were taken with the Affirmation of Commitments (AoC)  an
agreement between ICANN and the US Department of Commerce  the US Government
still maintains an oversight role over ICANN s compliance with the AoC and takes that
into account at the time of IANA contract renewal  While some actors believe that the
relationship with the US Government has brought stability  concerns have also been
raised  based on concerns of trust and lack of equality among countries  So far  the
proposal that has garnered the most support has been the  globalization  of ICANN 
keeping it accountable to all stakeholders  although there is disagreement on what that
would entail  other than replacement of the US Government as IANA contract
counterparty  The bottom line is that the way forward for the organization must be
discussed with the ICANN community and carried out after careful reflection 
ICANN is currently subject to the laws of the State of California  The Affirmation of
Commitments requires ICANN to remain headquartered in the United States of
America  The AOC can be canceled by either party upon provision of 120 days  notice 
Some nation-states and some members of the ICANN community have called for the
globalization of the IANA function part of ICANN 
Administration of the root zone function should meet several criteria  (1) protection of
root zone management from political or other improper interference; (2) integrity 
stability  continuity  security and robustness of the administration of the root zone; (3)
widespread trust by Internet users in the administration of this function; (4) support for a
public  globally unified DNS namespace; and (5) agreement regarding an accountability
mechanism for this function 
The current IANA contract with the US NTIA satisfies these criteria  but some believe
there is a potential political dimension to the administration of this function  Equally 
some in the ICANN stakeholder community also believe that such globalization is not
needed at the present time 
At present  the ICANN Board has voted to explore the options possible in the
globalization of the IANA function part of ICANN  Again  these options must be
discussed with the ICANN community 
3 3 International Frameworks for ICANN s Accountability
ICANN is currently accountable through the AoC  Any globalization of ICANN would
require the creation of a new framework for ICANN s accountability  It is the position of
the CCWG that here again  the ICANN stakeholder community must be consulted at all
levels of the design of such a framework  should this be decided 
Part IV  Conclusions
The ICANN stakeholder community is a microcosm of the world s diversity of
population  It has years of experience in developing operational policy that serves the
Internet by operating an evolving but stable set of names  addresses and protocols 
Operation of ICANN as a bottom-up  consensus-based  multistakeholder model has
both been a challenge and a success  judged by the fact that for the 15 years of
ICANN s existence  the DNS has performed as it should and its Top Level Domain
space continues to grow  The diversity of ICANN s stakeholder communities will often
cause disagreements among its various components  but ICANN has provided a
wonderful platform open to everyone for engagement and a search for the common
good -- to find a solution to the challenges that any network growing at the pace of the
Internet would face 
The ICANN stakeholder community is an inherent part of all of the global Internet
communities  The CCWG looks forward to continuing to work to make ICANN a better
organization 
Appendix A  Definitions of the terms used
In this section  we provide a backgrounder on the definitions that we attribute to certain
terms used in this contribution  The definitions of these terms are not meant to serve as
universal definitions but rather as the meaning of those terms in the context of this
contribution in order to avoid ambiguity 
What is a multistakeholder model 
The Multistakeholder Model (MsM)  as opposed to the Multilateral Model (MlM)  which
we describe in more detail below  provides all interested parties a voice in critical
decision-making processes  Within the MsM  different stakeholders may take the lead
on particular matters based on their competency and mandate  but transparency and
dialogue are key to the success of multistakeholder processes  Within the context of
ICANN  the multistakeholder model refers to the bottom-up  consensus-based process
by which stakeholders who participate in ICANN develop policies related to Internet
naming and numbering  as well as policies to support the security  stability  and
interoperability of the global Internet  Participants in ICANN s multistakeholder model
include businesses  civil society organizations  individual Internet users  technical
experts and governments  each with their respective roles  In the MsM  any individual
or organization may voice an opinion  and ideally  all opinions and ideas are considered
on their own merits 
What is a multilateral model 
The Multilateral Model (MlM) is a decision-making process wherein nation-states or a
closed stakeholder group negotiate policy among themselves  In an ideal process  the
negotiating parties are expected to voice the interests of their citizens or members 
Due to the closed nature of the process  citizens  businesses  civil society organizations
and technical experts cannot participate directly in decision-making in a multilateral
decision making process  Some multilateral organizations do offer consultative status
to non-governmental stakeholders that may or may not be binding for the parties raising
the consultation  The OECD is an example of a governmental multilateral body while
FIFA or the FiA may be seen as private sector multilateral bodies 
ICANN Component Organizations
Address Supporting Organization (ASO)
The ASO is the body that advises the ICANN Board regarding policy issues relating to
the operation  assignment  and management of Internet addresses - otherwise known
at Internet Protocol Addresses (IP addresses)  Every computer or other device
connected to the Internet needs an IP address 
Country Code Names Supporting Organization (ccNSO)
The ccNSO is the policy-development body responsible for  (i) developing and
recommending to the Board global policies relating to country-code top-level domains;
(ii) nurturing consensus across the ccNSO's community  including the name-related
activities of ccTLDs; and (iii) coordinating with other ICANN Supporting Organizations 
committees  and constituencies under ICANN 
Generic Names Supporting Organization (GNSO)
The GNSO is responsible for developing and recommending to the ICANN Board
substantive policies relating to generic Top Level Domains (gTLDs); it does so through
the Policy Development Process  Changes to gTLD policy have broad impact beyond
the gTLD-related businesses (registries and registrars) that contract with ICANN  to
other stakeholders and ultimately to all users of the Internet 
GNSO stakeholders are organized into four  Stakeholder Groups   registries  registrars 
commercial stakeholders and noncommercial stakeholders  The Intellectual Property 
Internet Service Provider and Commercial and Business User constituencies are in the
Commercial Stakeholder Group  while the non-profit and non-commercial user
constituencies are in the Non-Commercial Stakeholder Group  The GNSO Council 
consisting of representatives of each Stakeholder Group  manages the PDP process
and approves policy recommendations from GNSO Working Groups  which develop the
recommendations 
One of the unique aspects of the GNSO is that the PDP is bottom-up  consensusbased 
and stakeholder-driven  and depends on extensive stakeholder involvement in
multistakeholder Working Groups  Working Groups are the heart of the GNSO and the
PDP  Working Groups are formed via Charters  which define the specific issues that
each group will address  While Working Groups typically have representatives from
each Stakeholder Group and liaisons from other ICANN bodies (e g   ALAC and the
ccNSO)  anyone can participate  Working Groups operate by consensus and develop
detailed policy recommendations through meetings and the development of a
substantial report  Preliminary reports are subject to public comment  which are taken
into account when preparing the final report  The recommendations in the Working
Group reports  once approved by the GNSO Council  are sent to the Board for adoption
as ICANN gTLD policy 
At-Large Advisory Committee (ALAC)
"At-Large" is the name for the community of individual Internet users who participate in
the policy development work of ICANN  The 15 member At-Large Advisory Committee
(ALAC) is responsible for considering and providing advice on the activities of ICANN
as they relate to the interests of individual Internet users (the  At-Large  community) 
ICANN  as a private sector non-profit corporation with technical management
responsibilities for the Internet s domain name and address system  relies on the ALAC
and the broader At-Large community to involve and represent in ICANN a broad set of
individual Internet user interests 
Governmental Advisory Committee (GAC)
The GAC provides advice on the activities of ICANN as they relate to concerns of
governments  particularly matters where there may be interaction between ICANN's
policies and various laws and international agreements or where ICANN s policies may
affect public policy issues  According to ICANN s Bylaws   GAC advice on public policy
matters shall be duly taken into account  both in the formulation and adoption of
policies  If the Board determines to take an action that is not consistent with the GAC
advice  it shall so inform the Committee and state the reasons why it decided not to
follow that advice  
Security and Stability Advisory Committee (SSAC)
The SSAC advises the ICANN community and Board on matters relating to the security
and integrity of the Internet's naming and address allocation systems  which
encompasses operational matters (e g   matters pertaining to the correct and reliable
operation of the root name system)  administrative matters (e g   matters pertaining to
address allocation and Internet number assignment)  and registration matters (e g  
matters pertaining to registry and registrar services such as WHOIS)  SSAC engages in
ongoing threat assessment and risk analysis of the Internet naming and address
allocation services to assess where the principal threats to stability and security lie  and
advises the ICANN community accordingly 
Root Server System Advisory Committee (RSSAC)
The RSSAC is the body that advises the ICANN community and Board on matters
relating to the operation  administration  security  and integrity of the Internet's Root
Server System 
Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF)
The IETF s mission is to make the Internet work better by producing high quality 
relevant technical documents that influence the way people design  use and manage
the Internet  Anyone may participate in the IETF process  making the organization truly
multistakeholder  but individuals are expected to represent only themselves  not their
companies  governments  or other organizations  Thus  individuals are expected to
bring their best ideas for the Internet rather than represent any one constituency 
Work within the IETF is organized in working groups  Working group chairs are
responsible for managing the process within the group  The process of drafting an IETF
standard typically begins at the working group level  Anyone can submit an idea for a
standard for the working group to consider  People in the working group comment on
whether to take up the work or not  and if it is agreed by consensus to take up the item 
the document becomes a working group item  The working group then jointly develops
the content of the standard itself through iteration  Once the document is largely
agreed  it goes to working group last call  at this point  everyone in the working group
reads the document and provides final feedback  If achieved  the standard goes to the
IETF as a whole for discussion and consensus before a standard becomes final 
While the IETF holds three meetings a year  much of the work associated with
developing a standard takes place over working group email lists  and working group
chairs must consult the list before determining that consensus exists  The culture of the
IETF places a premium on individuals representing themselves  not their organizations 
interests  Calls for comment are iterative and ongoing in the early stages of document
development  increasing the likelihood that major issues are considered and resolved
before last call and generally streamlining the process 
The standards developed at IETF are needed to make the Internet interoperable  and
they affect all Internet users  Because of these effects  standards development
processes must remain open to all interested parties  and decision-making should be
transparent  Accordingly  participants in IETF processes strive to maintain a level of
awareness of the potential social and economic impact of their efforts which
distinguishes the entire process from any other technical body 

Short Comment on  Internet Universality  

 

Basic Interoperability as a Prior Principle

 

 

 

by Seth Johnson

 

 

 

 

UNESCO proposes a catchphrase of "Internet Universality" as an Internet Principle1  presenting the term as encapsulating and representing the interdependent way the concerns of Rights  Openness  Accessibility and Multistakeholderism interact with each other in addressing issues  Another contribution from UNESCO proposes to study Internet-related issues with reference to the same rubric2 

 

I offer this comment simply to encourage understanding that a simple general appeal to the notion of universality should be considered with great care  Implementing "universal" policy solutions by establishing rules that apply between networks can easily interfere with the flexibility of the Internet platform 

 

This is particularly important given that the WSIS project fails to distinguish between the Internet and other IP-based networks  including Next-generation networks3  The ITU's proceedings instead refer to ICT applications  supported by IP-based networks  as means for addressing various public policy concerns  If we are speaking of the universality of IP addresses for designating endpoints  the term Internet Universality presents few problems  But if universality is seen to be something that more greatly supports a policy purpose and that may be implemented by means of particular policies that apply between autonomous networks  the notion will serve to undermine the flexibility and openness of the Internet 

 

It is far better to stress a principle of first recognizing how the great flexibility and interoperability of the Internet derives from the way the Internet Protocol enables interoperability between autonomous networks  and then to consider various functions proposed to be implemented as "universal" principles in terms of their impact on the Internet platform
