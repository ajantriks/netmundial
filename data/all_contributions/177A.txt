Abstract
The ICANN Cross Community Working Group (CCWG) on Internet Governance drafted
this contribution using multistakeholder principles. The CCWG is an ad-hoc group
comprised of members of ICANN?s Supporting Organisations as well as GNSO
Stakeholder Groups and constituencies. The concepts expressed in this paper resulted
from discussion on the CCWG?s mailing list, input provided through the CCWG Wiki
space (https://community.icann.org/x/kyWfAg), and weekly conference calls from
January - March 2014.As the CCWG is commenting on ICANN, and on ICANN's role
within the larger Internet Governance Ecosystem in preparation for a contribution to the
NETMundial Conference, these comments should be viewed as preliminary and focused
on the entities within the IG Ecosystem that we have been able to consider in the short
timeframe for preparing this submission. It is possible that further collaboration may lead
to changes and enhancements to the CCWG views.
