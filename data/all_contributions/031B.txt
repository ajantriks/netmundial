Message from the Multi-stakeholder Advisory Group (MAG) coming from MAG meeting which took place in Geneva, Switzerland from 19-20 February:

 

The NETmundial meeting and the concerns that led to its creation were part of the public discussions during the IGF in Bali  in October 2013. Members of the MAG look forward to the discussions in Sao Paulo in April 2014 and consider it one among many important fora and events this year that will address Internet governance issues. 

 

The IGF has already proven its relevance; already several dozen national and regional IGF platforms have been created, covering all continents.  As NetMundial is discussing global IG principles and the evolution of the Internet multistakeholder ecosystem, we urge that the concept of multistakeholder discussion platform of Internet governance related issues as embodied in the IGF should be incorporated in recommendations for any future arrangements.

 

We also recognize that discussions of this nature are  underway in many other fora including the WSIS+10 Review process, the UN CSTD WGEC, CSTD in June, and within a number of the UN agencies and in many other fora.

 

 

The MAG and all stakeholders are in the process of implementing the improvements and enhancements agreed to through the CSTD WG on Improvements to the IGF, and there are ongoing discussions within the MAG regarding strengthening the role and effectiveness of the IGF. 

 

We have started our open consultation process in preparation for the 2014 IGF in Istanbul with the express intent of including in the IGF program open, multistakeholder consideration of outputs from the NETmundial meeting and other fora as outlined above. IGF looks forward to inviting representatives from the NETmundial meeting and other appropriate fora and processes to report on and discuss their work and outcomes in Istanbul.
