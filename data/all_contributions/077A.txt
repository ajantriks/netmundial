Abstract
The representatives of Denmark would like to express our gratitude for the invitation to the
Netmundial Global Multistakeholder Meeting on the Future of Internet Governance as well
as for the opportunity to deliver our comments in preparation of the meeting. Denmark
supports a single, free, unfragmented internet governed by a genuine multistakeholder
model. The internet has served as an unparalleled promoter of economic growth and
cross-border sharing of information. However, this will only continue if the internet is
perceived as trustworthy and the protection of basic human rights, such as the right to
privacy, seems to be a prerequisite to that. We believe that the point of departure for the
development of a list of internet governance principles should be already existing texts
such as the OECD's Principles for Internet Policy-making.
