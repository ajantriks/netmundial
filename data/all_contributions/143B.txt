NETmundial: Response to Call for Submissions
The Number Resource Organization (NRO)
7 March 2014
The Number Resource Organization (NRO), on behalf of the five Regional Internet Registries
(RIRs), AFRINIC, APNIC, ARIN, LACNIC, and RIPE NCC offers this submission to the
“NETmundial”1, addressing each of the two submission topics: “Internet Governance
Principles”, and “Roadmap for the Further Evolution of the Internet Governance Ecosystem”.
Section 1. Internet Governance Principles
• The
“working
definition”
of
Internet
Governance2,
established
by
the
Working
Group
on
Internet
Governance3,
is
now
well
accepted
and
should
remain
in
place
for
the
purposes
of
the
NETmundial
meeting,
and
for
the
future.
We
believe
that
there
is
no
need
to
revise
this
definition.
“We support the existing definition of Internet Governance”
• The
subject
of
Internet
Governance
is
the
Internet
as
we
know
it
and
its
core
values,
including
a
set
of
essential
evolutionary
and
identifiable,
technical,
operational
and
organizational
features
which
have
been
critical
to
its
success.
“The subject of Internet Governance discussions is the Internet as we know it and its core
values”
• Among
these
features
is
the
“multistakeholder
model”
of
governance
and
cooperation,
which
was
also
identified
during
the
World
Summit
on
the
Information
Society
(WSIS)
process.
While
not
named
as
such,
this
model
has
been
in
operation
since
the
earliest
days
of
the
Internet,
in
various
forms
and
instances.
These
include
open
and
consensus-­-
based
processes
for
standards
and
policy
development,
cooperative
operational
forums
active
at
various
levels
of
infrastructure
and
service,
and
widespread
distribution
of
functions
among
diverse
and
autonomous
cooperating
organizations.
“The multistakeholder model has been and continues to be fundamental to the success of
the Internet”
• General
principles
of
Internet
Governance
have
been
discussed
many
times
and
can
be
approached
in
various
ways.
A
group
of
Internet
technical
community
organizations
and
individuals
have
agreed
on
a
set
of
observations
and
recommendations,
known
as

“Internet
Governance
Observations
and
Recommendations
from
Members
of
the
Internet
Technical
Community"
that
were
submitted
to
NETmundial.
In
referring
to
this
document,
we
stress
the
importance
of
a
sustainable
and
effective
bridge
between
Internet
technical
coordination
and
public
policy
processes.
• An
expert
panel
which
examined
“ICANN’s
Role
in
the
Internet
Governance
Ecosystem”4
has
also
produced
a
valuable
report
which
articulated
“5
Rs”
–
the
principles
of
Reciprocity,
Respect,
Robustness,
Reasonableness
and
Reality
–
which
have
been
applied
in
a
variety
of
Internet
Governance
processes
such
as
those
facilitated
by
the
RIRs,
the
Internet
Engineering
Task
Force
(IETF)5
and
others.
We
support
this
formulation,
but
also
agree
with
the
Panel
that
we
do
not
seek
a
“single
constitutional
moment”
for
Internet
Governance.
“There
is
no
one
set
of
Internet
Governance
principles;
however
we
highlight
the
report
of
the
ICANN
Strategy
Panel
on
‘ICANN´s
Role
in
Internet
Governance
Ecosystem’,
and
the
NETmundial
submission
by
members
of
the
technical
community”.
• Importantly,
as
identified
by
the
WSIS
process,
Internet
Governance
must
be
advanced
through
suitable
processes
that
respect
and
enhance
the
multistakeholder
model.
Such
processes
already
exist
for
certain
governance
issues
in
various
communities
and
jurisdictions.
The
Internet
Governance
Forum6
(IGF)
was
established
as
the
foremost
open
and
inclusive,
non-­-decision-­-making
global
forum
in
which
Internet
Governance
matters
can
be
discussed
and
advanced.
The
IGF
has
become
the
central
element
of
the
global
Internet
Governance
environment,
even
while
it
matures
to
better
meet
evolving
challenges.
“The Internet Governance Forum should remain a central element of the global Internet
Governance environment”
• The
NETmundial
is
understood
to
be
a
one-­-time
event,
that
should
address
questions
of
how
Internet
Governance
issues
are
handled
(whether
individually
or
in
aggregates),
the
applicability
and
quality
of
multistakeholder
governance
activities,
and
the
evolution
of
the
governance
model.
How
Internet
Governance
is
conducted
is
itself
an
Internet
Governance
issue,
and
as
such,
fits
clearly
within
the
mandate
of
the
IGF.
To
create
a
competing
forum
would
only
cause
confusion
and
fragmentation
in
a
set
of
processes
that
should
operate
with
maximum
accessibility,
inclusion
and
convergence.
“NETmundial and any other initiatives should be coordinated and complementary to the
IGF.”

Section 2. Roadmap for the Further Evolution of the Internet Governance Ecosystem
We make the following recommendations for the future of Internet Governance. Our
recommendations are not exhaustive, but are essential to successful Internet Governance in the
future.
First, on the question of ICANN and the associated IANA activities we would assert that
governance of these functions must be undertaken consistently with accepted principles of
Internet Governance, as outlined in the 2013 Montevideo Statement7. That statement called for
accelerating the globalization of ICANN and the IANA functions towards an environment where
all stakeholders, including all governments, participate on an equal footing. Aside from these
broad principles, the details of any transition and any new arrangements should not be a primary
focus for NETmundial.
Secondly,
we
would
like
to
make
the
following
recommendations
on
the
Internet
Governance
Forum
(IGF):
1. Internet
Governance
will
remain
important
to
the
global
community
for
as
long
as
the
Internet
continues
to
grow
and
evolve.
Therefore
we
propose
a
renewal
of
current
IGF
arrangements
for
a
further
10
years
after
the
current
5-­-year
cycle.
A
longer-­-term
renewal
of
the
IGF
mandate
should
not
preclude
an
evolutionary
transition
of
the
IGF
to
a
more
sustainable
model.
This
will
promote
a
clearer
understanding
of
its
importance,
legitimacy
and
longevity.
2. The
IGF
must
continue
as
a
“non-­-binding”
forum,
and
produce
useful
outputs,
through
appropriate
participatory
and
consensus-­-based
decision-­-making
processes.
These
may
take
the
form
of
reports
from
IGF
meetings
and
processes,
informational
papers
resulting
from
emerging
working
groups,
and
non-­-binding
recommendations
based
on
case
studies
and
emergent
best
practices.
3. The
IGF
needs
to
evolve
and
be
strengthened.
Some
evolutionary
changes
may
gain
impetus
from
external
processes,
such
as
NETmundial.
They
must
be
subject
to
review
through
the
IGF
process
itself
to
ensure
that
multistakeholder
legitimacy
is
continually
maintained
and
enhanced.
4. The
IGF’s
Multistakeholder
Advisory
Group
(MAG)8
has
played
an
important
role
in
the
IGF.
It
is
essential
that
the
MAG
receive
strong
support
from
the
IGF
Secretariat.
Some
MAG
processes
could
also
improve,
including
transparency
and
predictability
of
selection
of
members.

5. Further
improvement
of
the
IGF
requires
a
strong,
stable
Secretariat,
with
the
human
and
financial
resources
to
effectively
meet
a
range
of
administrative
tasks,
including
IGF
site
selection,
negotiation
with
hosts,
design
of
the
event,
funding
and
fundraising,
reporting,
planning
and
resourcing.
6. The
IGF
has
benefited
greatly
from
intersessional
activities,
including
national
and
regional
IGF
events9.
These
IGF-­-related
events
have
proven
to
very
beneficial
in
increasing
the
reach
and
impact
of
the
overall
IGF
process.
There
is
a
need
for
ongoing
support
to
inter-­-link
them
with
an
overall
IGF
process
in
a
way
that
increases
their
value
for
all
participants.
7. In
addition
and
complimentary
to
these
IGF
events,
ongoing
multi-­-stakeholder
discussions
are
occurring
online
in
a
number
of
forums.
These
discussions
have
tended
to
be
specific
to
stakeholder
communities
rather
than
encompassing
all
stakeholders.
We
recommend
that
“/1net”
be
recognized
as
one
encompassing
multistakeholder
forum
for
holding
intersessional
IGF
related
discussions
in
an
open
and
constructive
manner
and
for
building
consensus
to
be
channeled
through
IGF.
