Abstract
The future of Internet governance cannot be assimilated to the future of ICANN. This
contribution offers a fresh and thought provocative vision of a complete new grand design.
Without minimizing the importance of technical functions such as IANA, the contribution
takes a look at Internet Governance through a more ?constitutional and universal?
perspective. By proposing a 2-entity eco-system in order to protect an Internet universal
Charter (principles), and turn it into reality, this contribution is trying to bring innovation
and disruptive thinking. This contribution starts with a double assumption. It looks at
Multistakeholderism and its critic. If it is a smart tool to foster dialogue, invented by
business schools to serve corporations facing social and policy issues, it cannot deal
effectively with public policy making and social justice. Only Democratic values, principles
and processes can deliver a sustainable governance for the Internet at a national and
global level.
