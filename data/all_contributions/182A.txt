Short Comment on “Internet Universality:”
Basic Interoperability as a Prior Principle
by Seth Johnson
UNESCO proposes a catchphrase of "Internet Universality" as an Internet Principle1,
presenting the term as encapsulating and representing the interdependent way the
concerns of Rights, Openness, Accessibility and Multistakeholderism interact with each
other in addressing issues. Another contribution from UNESCO proposes to study Internetrelated
issues with reference to the same rubric2.
I offer this comment simply to encourage understanding that a simple general appeal to
the notion of universality should be considered with great care. Implementing "universal"
policy solutions by establishing rules that apply between networks can easily interfere with
the flexibility of the Internet platform.
This is particularly important given that the WSIS project fails to distinguish between the
Internet and other IP-based networks, including Next-generation networks3. The ITU's
proceedings instead refer to ICT applications, supported by IP-based networks, as means
for addressing various public policy concerns. If we are speaking of the universality of IP
addresses for designating endpoints, the term Internet Universality presents few
problems. But if universality is seen to be something that more greatly supports a policy
purpose and that may be implemented by means of particular policies that apply between
autonomous networks, the notion will serve to undermine the flexibility and openness of
the Internet.
It is far better to stress a principle of first recognizing how the great flexibility and
interoperability of the Internet derives from the way the Internet Protocol enables
interoperability between autonomous networks, and then to consider various functions
proposed to be implemented as "universal" principles in terms of their impact on the
Internet platform.
