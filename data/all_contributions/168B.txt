Executive Summary
Overview
Although cyber conflict is no longer considered particularly unusual, significant
uncertainties remain about the nature, scale, scope and other critical features of it. This
study addresses a subset of these issues by developing an internally consistent framework
and applying it to a series of 17 case studies. We present each case in terms of (a) its
socio-political context, (b) technical features, (c) the outcome and inferences drawn in
the sources examined. The profile of each case includes the actors, their actions, tools
they used and power relationships, and the outcomes with inferences or observations. Our
findings include:
• Cyberspace has brought in a number of new players – activists, shady government
contractors – to international conflict, and traditional actors (notably states) have
increasingly recognized the importance of the domain.
• The involvement of the private sector on cybersecurity (“cyber defense”) has been
critical: 16 out of the 17 cases studied involved the private sector either in attack
or defense.
• All of the major international cyber conflicts presented here have been related to
an ongoing conflict (“attack” or “war”) in the physical domain.
• Rich industrialized countries with a highly developed ICT infrastructure are at a
higher risk concerning cyber attacks.
• Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) is by far the most common type of cyber
attack.
• Air-gapped (not connected to the public Internet) networks have not been exempt
from attacks.
• A perpetrator does not need highly specialized technical knowledge to intrude
computer networks.
• The potential damage of a cyber strike is likely to continue increasing as the
Internet expands.
• The size of the actor under attack could have an influence on its ability to deter
the attackers with actions in the physical world.
• The entrance barriers (including the monetary cost) for any actor to get involved
in a conflict seem to be much lower in the cyber domain than in the physical
domain.
• Accountability on the Internet is difficult, and gets further obscured when the
attacks transcend national borders. This fact has probably made cyber attacks
desirable for major military powers such as China, Russia and the United States.
In many ways, this paper is a re-analysis of the case studies set presented on A Fierce
Domain: Conflict in Cyberspace, 1986 to 2012 recently published by the Atlantic
Council. In addition, we draw upon other materials (academic and media) to expand our
understanding of each case, and add several cases to the original collection resulting in a
data set of 17 cyber conflict, spanning almost three decades (1985-2013). Cuckoo's Egg,
Morris Worm, Solar Sunrise, Electronic Disturbance Theater, ILOVEYOU, Chinese
Espionage, Estonia, Russo-Georgian war, Conficker, NSA-Snowden, WikiLeaks and
Stuxnet are some of the major cases included.
Method And Organization
This study presents each case in terms of (a) its socio-political context, (b) technical
features, (c) the outcome and inferences drawn in the sources examined. Emphasis is
placed on characteristics of cyberspace visible on conflicts.
Present work is divided in several sections. Part I presents the cases in terms of the actors
involved, their power relationship, main actions, layers of the Internet affected, and
outcome. Part II expands on the tools and instruments used on the cyber offensive and
defensive actions described on Part I, including an extended view of the layers of the
Internet affected. Part III presents the author’s inferences and observations for each case,
highlighting features of cyber conflict. Part IV presents a set of conclusions highlighting
critical features related to: actors, socio-political context, tools and other technical issues,
sophistication of the attacks, outcome and damage, and accountability.
Countries Involved
Findings presented in this study are U.S.-centered, as this paper was developed using
such a focus. However, 23 countries are involved in at least one case, either in attack or
defense. Countries involved in two or more cases are (frequency in parenthesis): United
States (16), Russia (7), China (3), Israel (3), The Netherlands (2) and Germany (2). Six of
the cases presented had a global reach.

Abstract
Twenty years ago, the possibility of having an international conflict extend into the cyber domain
was distant. Since then much has changed. Today cyber conflict is not considered particularly
unusual. But considerable uncertainties remain about the nature, scale, scope and other features of
such conflicts. This paper addresses these issues using a re-analysis of the case studies presented
in A Fierce Domain recently published by the Atlantic Council. In addition, we draw upon other
materials (academic and media) to expand our understanding of each case, and add several cases
to the original collection resulting in a data set of 17 cyber conflict, spanning almost three
decades (1985-2013). Cuckoo's Egg, Morris Worm, Solar Sunrise, EDT, ILOVEYOU, Chinese
Espionage, Estonia, Russo-Georgian war, Conficker, NSA-Snowden, WikiLeaks and Stuxnet are
some of the major cases included. This study presents each case in terms of (a) its socio-political
context, (b) technical features, (c) the outcome and inferences drawn in the sources examined.
The profile of each case includes the actors, their actions, tools they used and power relationships,
and the outcomes with inferences or observations. Emphasis is placed on characteristics of
cyberspace visible on conflicts. Findings include: Distributed Denial of Service is the most
common offensive action; accountability is difficult in cyberspace, particularly with international
conflicts; outcomes of each instance have been variable, and economic impact is hard to estimate;
the private sector has been a key player in cybersecurity; size of an actor, and countries' ICT
infrastructure, influence the nature of the cyber conflicts.

The Underground Policy Fight Over The American Residential Internet
For
millions
of
people
around
the
world,
the
Internet
is
almost
a
necessity.
We
use
it
to
communicate
with
our
family,
friends,
employer,
partners,
random
acquaintances,
and
virtually
everyone
we
get
in
touch
with.
The
Internet
has
become
a
platform
for
expression
(political
or
otherwise),
lust,
friendship,
anger,
and
an
infinite
spectrum
of
human
emotions.
Day
after
day
we
read
stories
of
how
the
Internet
is
enabling
forms
of
communication,
economic
exchanges,
scientific
development
and
so
on.
As
a
pervasive
phenomenon,
the
Internet
seems
to
be
a
very
positive
one.
For
the
average
user
(if
not
most
users),
the
seamless
operation
of
browsing
through
a
website,
using
an
iPhone
app,
or
watching
a
TV
show
on
Netflix
is
just
that:
a
series
of
automatic
responses
to
the
commands
given
to
the
system.
Such
services,
however,
are
not
delivered
by
magic.
Information
is
exchanged
between
us
and
our
providers
using
networks.
In
the
most
simplistic
terms,
our
computers
are
connected
to
an
Internet
Service
Provider
(ISP),
and
they
connect
us
to
the
content
we
are
trying
to
access
(or
transmit
the
information
we
want
to
upload).
They
allow
us
to
watch
web-­-based
TV,
browse,
work,
and
have
fun
on
the
Internet.
One
could
go
as
far
as
to
say
that
ISPs
are
the
Internet.
As
the
reader
might
infer,
the
story
is
not
as
simple.
Internet’s
fluent
operation
is
based
on
complex
agreements
among
infrastructure
owners
(ISPs,
transit
providers,
undersea
cable
operators),
application
providers
(DSPs1),
content
delivery
networks
(CDNs),
content
owners,
to
name
only
the
most
salient
ones.
There
are
big,
powerful
corporations
falling
under
each

these
categories,
all
looking
to
extract
revenues
from
the
American
consumers.
The
infrastructure
itself
is
also
a
puzzle
of
wires,
pipes,
technical
protocols,
radio
communication
towers,
servers,
and
many
other
components.
I
do
not
intend
to
describe
the
Internet
in
more
detail,
but
it
is
not
hard
to
see
how
this
enormous,
messy
network
can
be
a
policymaker’s
nightmare.
How
do
you
regulate
a
network
that
is
so
poorly
understood
by
most
of
its
users?
How
can
the
government
issue
any
policies
pertaining
a
network
that
was
built
and
is
operated
and
serviced
almost
exclusively
by
private
actors?
The
Internet,
however,
did
not
emerge
out
of
nowhere.
ISPs
consist
mostly
of
cable
TV
and
telephone
providers,
especially
for
residential
users.
With
the
advent
of
Voice
over
Internet
Protocol
(VoIP)
and
web
video
streaming,
these
companies
faced
a
dilemma.
On
the
one
hand,
they
had
clear
incentives
to
block
or
degrade
the
performance
of
services
that
directly
competed
with
their
own
offerings
of
traditional
cable
TV
and
telephone.
On
the
other
hand,
their
consumers
demanded
new
applications,
such
as
Netflix,
YouTube,
or
Skype,
to
be
delivered
over
the
Internet
for
which
they
pay
money
every
month.
Other
than
protection
of
intellectual
property,
the
regulation
of
this
apparent
conflict
of
interest
has
been
the
most
important
Internet
policy
controversy
in
recent
times.
Network “Neutrality”
In
the
United
States,
the
Federal
Communication
Commission
(FCC)
is
the
closest
thing
to
an
Internet
regulatory
agency.
During
the
George
W.
Bush
Administration,
however,
the
FCC
Alexander
Gamero-­-Garrido
|
Technology
and
Policy
Program,
MIT
decided
that
it
would
take
a
hands-­-off
approach,
and
classified
the
Internet
as
an
Information
Service.
By
doing
so,
the
FCC
itself
greatly
restricted
its
regulatory
authority
over
the
Internet.
As
more
services
move
online,
calls
for
regulation
became
increasingly
frequent.
One
of
FCC’s
responses
to
such
calls
was
the
2010
Open
Internet
Report
and
Order
(OIRO),
which
among
other
things
prevented
ISPs
from
blocking
entire
classes
of
Internet
traffic
(e.g.
VoIP).
In
the
words
of
the
Commission:
“broadband
providers
should
not
pick
winners
and
losers
on
the
Internet—even
for
reasons
that
may
be
independent
of
providers’
competitive
interests
(…).”2
What
did
the
commissioners
mean
by
“pick[ing]
winners
and
losers”?
From
a
bird’s
eye
view,
they
refer
to
a
limited
and
valuable
resource:
residential
bandwidth.
In
this
context,
bandwidth
refers
to
the
speed
with
which
a
connection
can
transmit
information,
and
is
normally
measured
in
megabytes
per
second.
It
is
the
FCC’s
policy
that
it
should
be
the
consumer,
and
not
the
ISP,
who
selects
how
bandwidth
should
be
allocated.
Although
this
seems
to
point
to
a
proposition
of
liberty
(from
ISP
limitations),
it
is
an
argument
about
equity.
Every
consumer
should
have
the
right
to
select
from
her
favorite
service
provider,
and
such
provider
should
be
allocated
an
equal
portion
of
the
available
bandwidth
on
the
ISP
network.
As
with
Stone’s
chocolate
cake3,
splitting
bandwidth
equally
is
not
necessarily
the
fairest
distribution.
Specific
applications
such
as
VoIP
are
more
time-­-sensitive
than
others,
such
as
bulk-­-transfers4.
ISPs,
then,
routinely
have
to
prioritize
entire
classes
of
traffic
over
others.
Since
you,
my
theoretical
neighbor,
are
having
a
telephone
conversation
that
gets
messed
up
if

is
a
long
delay,
I
might
have
to
wait
a
few
extra
minutes
to
complete
my
Game
of
Thrones
download,
even
though
we
both
pay
the
same
monthly
fee
for
our
Internet
service.
If
later
I
decide
to
call
my
brother
overseas
using
Skype,
and
you
decide
to
download
music,
it
is
my
traffic
that
will
be
prioritized.
A
grounded
example
of
this
treatment
is
the
priority
that
ambulances,
police
and
firefighter
vehicles
get
when
on
duty:
we,
the
rest
of
the
drivers,
recognize
that
they
have
a
legitimate
reason
to
be
in
a
hurry
and
(usually)
modify
our
behavior.
We
temporarily
put
their
interests
ahead
of
our
own.
In
Stone’s
language
this
would
be
unequal
(Internet)
traffic
priority
for
equal
traffic
types.
This
form
of
discrimination
is
routinely
used
by
ISPs
to
improve
the
performance
of
the
network
for
all
of
their
customers;
this
sounds
like
a
legitimate
policy.
A
perfectly
neutral
network
would
not
allow
for
such
discrimination.
Are
the
operators,
however,
really
looking
to
improve
the
performance
of
every
service,
including
those
competing
with
their
own?
Network “openness”
In
order
to
make
VoIP
and
other
delay-­-sensitive
applications
work,
ISPs
inspect
residential
traffic
to
prioritize
such
services.
In
this
very
act,
proponents
of
neutrality
argue,
is
embedded
the
possibility
to
harm
competitors
in
an
“unfair”
way.
Neutralers,
as
I
will
call
the
proponents
of
network
neutrality
regulation,
claim
that
if
the
government
does
not
regulate,
ISPs
will
degrade
the
performance
of
competing
services,
especially
video
web
streaming
and
telephony
delivered
over
the
Internet.
It
is
precisely
the
providers
of
those
downstream
services,
such
as
Google,
who
compose
a
big
chunk
of
the
neutralers.
Their
counterpart
in
the
debate
are
the
ISPs,
particularly
big
ones
such
as
Verizon
or
Comcast.

Although
this
seems
to
be
a
very
technical
discussion,
proponents
and
antagonists
of
neutrality
are
really
arguing
about
liberty
versus
control.
Neutralers
would
like
to
see
a
very
competitive
market5,
where
consumers
can
choose
between
many
ISPs
and,
most
importantly,
get
to
decide
what
kind
of
classes
are
a
priority
for
themselves.
In
a
perfectly
neutral
world,
it
would
be
up
to
the
user
to
choose
their
provider
of
Internet
TV,
VoIP,
news,
social
networking
or
pornographic
content.
ISPs,
neutralers
continue,
have
no
business
in
deciding
what
is
a
priority
for
all
the
Joe
Smiths
of
America.
There
should
be
only
minimal
traffic
control
allowed,
as
to
ensure
minimal
invasion
of
consumer
liberty
and
protect
offerings
of
competitive
services.
Comcast,
neutralers
argue,
should
not
be
capable
of
allocating
a
speedy
lane
to
its
own
Xfinity
web
TV,
to
the
harm
of
Netflix
or
Hulu.
We
can
all
get
behind
this
concept
in
theory.
After
all,
the
Internet
has
been
infused
with
the
values
of
its
creator,
the
United
States,
which
proclaims
to
be
a
beacon
of
liberty,
openness
and
opportunity
in
the
world.
Neutralers,
however,
paint
a
picture
of
control
that
is
very
incomplete,
and
therefore
misleading.
In
today’s
Internet,
not
all
traffic
is
treated
equally.
Besides
priority
by
traffic
class,
there
are
companies
(CDNs)
specialized
in
improving
the
performance
of
DSPs
such
as
YouTube
or
Netflix.
The
latter
pay
big
bucks
to
have
their
content
delivered
effectively
to
their
subscribers.
It
is
not
only
ISPs,
then,
who
get
to
decide
whose
traffic
is
more
important.
Neutralers
would
like
to
portray
a
picture
where,
as
long
as
neutrality
rules
are
enforced,
over-­-
the-­-top
providers
are
all
equal.
CDNs
and
other
mechanisms,
however,
ensure
that

it
is

that
all

are

some
providers
are
more
equal
than
others6.
There
is
no
guarantee,
then,
that
neutralers’
call
for
regulation
based
on
liberty
and
equity
propositions
are
well
grounded
in
reality.
Network “management”
Whether
or
not
neutrality
rules
are
enforced
is
not
a
matter
of
individual
liberty.
There
are
plenty
of
ways
in
which
a
consumer
today
is
not
making
the
backstage
decisions
that
make
some
providers
thrive
and
others
succumb.
Neutralers
are,
therefore,
not

Smith’s
“invisible
hand”
of
consumer
choice
over
the
“dictatorship”
of

practices.
Both
sides
agree
that
there
must
be
some
level
of
traffic
discrimination
for
the
Internet
to
continue
shining.
The
fight
is
about
who
gets
to
control
such
traffic
discrimination.
This
is
a
classic
example
of
fighting
over
Harold
Lasswell’s
“who
gets
what,
when
and
how.”
It
is
a
struggle
for
the
right
to
control
a
process,
a
struggle
for
power.
ISPs
claim
that
they
have
spent
billions
of
dollars7
building
the
physical
infrastructure
that
allows
the
Internet
to
function.
It
is
their
network,
they
claim,
and
it
is
them
who
should
be
the
gatekeepers
of
residential
traffic.
Should
they
not
be
able
to
recover
their
investments,
the
Internet
in
the
United
States
will
stagnate,
since
they
will
not
build
new
pipes.
The
next
ten
million
American
users
may
never
get
to
see
a
provider
knocking
on
their
door
to
offer
them
affordable
Internet
access,
since
such
pipes
will
never
reach
their
house.

As
with
many
stories
of
decline8
this
one
plays
only
half
of
the
movie
(the
sad,
doomy
half).
It
conveniently
leaves
out
that
the
Internet
infrastructure
was
largely
built
on
public
land,
under
government
concessions,
and
that
therefore
ISPs
are
not
the
“owners”
of
such
a
network9.
They
might
own
the
wires,
and
they
might
have
paid
for
digging
the
pipes.
But
to
“own”
the
residential
Internet
is
a
very
different
thing,
a
much
bigger
ownership
claim
that
does
not
stand
minimal
scrutiny.
Firstly,
ISPs
accepted
a
great
deal
of
control
over
their
telephone
and
cable
networks
in
exchange
for
building
on
public
land10.
Secondly,
the
Internet
is
much
more
than
a
“series
of
tubes”11,
as
it
relies
on
many
protocols
and
soft
tools
that
have
been
developed
by
the
technical
community,
one
that
spans
way
beyond
the
ISPs
themselves.
Thirdly,
and
as
with
many
infrastructures12,
there
is
much
more
to
be
extracted
from
the
Internet
than
its
simple
data
transmission
capabilities.
As
I
argued
in
my
opening
paragraph,
the
Internet
is
now
ubiquitous.
It
is
hard
to
imagine
living
a
modern
life
without
the
Internet.
More
than
a
nice
thing
to
have,
the
Internet
has
become
a
necessity,
and
it
greatly
impacts
the
welfare
(or
the
“well
being”)
of
the
American
people.
To
claim
that
the
ISPs
should
be
the
only
ones
with
a
word
to
say
about
residential
network
management
practices
is
to
claim
that
ISPs
have
final
ruling
over
welfare
of
its
millions
of
users.
It
is
effectively
a
call
for
a
form
of
private
government.

Closing Notes
Policy
controversies
surrounding
network
neutrality
have
been
covered
with
a
veil
of
technicalities
and
proxies
that
masquerade
a
fight
over
values.
As
such,
what
is
at
stake
is
much
more
than
the
revenue
maximization
of
Comcast
or
Netflix13.
It
is
the
liberty,
equity
and
welfare
of
the
Internet:
the
most
transformational
technological
development
of
the
last
century,
with
enormous
consequences
for
the
American
way
of
living.
I
have
not
argued
for
or
against
neutrality
rules
myself,
as
my
objective
here
was
to
show
some
of
the
underlying
values
that
are
being
discussed.
It
is,
however,
one
of
the
most
challenging
policy
questions
of
this
time,
and
we
would
all
benefit
from
more
clarity
in
the
language
of
the
proponents
on
either
side.

debate,

opposing
sides.
