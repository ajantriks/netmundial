The Internet Governance Coalition (the “Coalition”) extends our sincere appreciation to Brazil for hosting the “Global Multistakeholder Meeting on the Future of Internet Governance,” to be held in São Paulo. The Meeting is taking place at a time when the topic of Internet governance is an issue of great interest around the world. The many major conferences and work efforts scheduled this year exemplify the accelerated pace of Internet governance discussions and make 2014 a particularly important year in the ongoing evolution of the Internet. Indeed, there are a host of institutions, each with different core functions and strengths, that address issues related to Internet governance.

 

The Coalition represents leading international Internet and telecom companies, including: Amazon, AT&T, Inc., Cisco Systems, Inc., Comcast NBCUniversal, Google Inc., Juniper Networks Inc., Microsoft Corporation, Telefónica, S.A., The Walt Disney Company, Time Warner Cable Inc., Twenty-First Century Fox Inc., and Verizon Communications Inc.  We believe a thriving Internet depends on a governance structure that is open, transparent, and representative of all stakeholders. The multistakeholder model approach to Internet governance has allowed for the creation of decentralized structures that have resulted in historic economic, social, and political development. This decentralized structure of the Internet has enabled individuals to access information and services, to connect and to communicate, and to share ideas and knowledge globally. By offering new possibilities for entrepreneurial creativity, the Internet has become a powerful engine for technological innovation, economic growth, and the preservation and promotion of cultural diversity. We believe this model, strengthened as necessary, will continue to best serve these shared goals and Internet users far into the future.  

 

These concepts are rooted in the 2005 Tunis Agenda for the Information Society that provided the foundational principles for Internet governance, which affirmed the multistakeholder, transparent, and democratic governance of the Internet, while at the same time recognizing the sovereignty of governments and rule of law. It is precisely because of this multistakeholder governance model that the Internet has grown into the transformative platform it is today. To say nothing of the broader social benefits from the Internet, its economic contributions have been astonishing. According to McKinsey Global Institute, the Internet accounts for 21 percent of GDP growth in the last five years in developed countries, and in 30 surveyed developing countries. 

 

We believe that preserving and advancing open and consultative decision-making is essential to ensuring that global citizens are able to take advantage of this transformative platform both now and in the future. As such, we support the following principles which we believe are essential to Internet governance:

 

·         Policies must ensure a safe, secure, open, interoperable, and sustainable Internet.

 

·         Policies must stimulate sustainable investment in and deployment of Internet networks and the industries and services that create demand for those networks.

 

·         Policies must support opening and maintaining international markets in a way that allows for the seamless flow of digital services, applications, products, and information.

 

·         Policies must foster innovation across Internet networks, services, and other sectors in the Internet ecosystem, including ensuring the protection of intellectual property.

 

·         Policies must support increased transparency and openness in intergovernmental organizations and multistakeholder mechanisms, to ensure that all stakeholders can participate meaningfully in key Internet policy discussions.  The quality of Internet governance decisions increases when diverse stakeholders choose to actively and consistently participate.

 

·         Policies must support capacity building and implementation of best practices in relation to network security.

 

·         Policies must support the rule of law which governments have primary responsibility for advancing.

 

The Coalition looks forward to working with all stakeholders to prepare for a successful Meeting in Brazil, and welcomes this opportunity for dialogue on these important issues. International consensus on Internet policies is unlikely to be realized at only one meeting. These debates will continue at future meetings, including the 2014 Internet Governance Forum, WSIS Review, and ITU Plenipotentiary, that, together with the “The Global Multistakeholder Meeting,” promise to make significant contributions to the ongoing global dialogue on Internet governance. 

 

The Coalition again extends its appreciation to the host country of Brazil and to CGI.br and /1net for their extraordinary and constructive work in organizing the Meeting.

 

 

  

Respectfully Submitted,
