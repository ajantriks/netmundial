fundamental freedoms, respect for rule of law and basic conditions for cybersecurity
Document
Austria welcomes the opportunity to contribute to the Global Multistakeholder Meeting on
the Future of Internet Governance “netmundial” and to the discussion on principles of
Internet Governance and on the roadmap for the further evolution of the Internet
governance ecosystem.
In particular, Austria expresses her gratitude to the Republic of Brazil for organizing this
important conference based on the agreed multistakeholder model in a transparent
manner and for providing a valuable set of declarations, statements and other documents
on Internet governance principles, thus underlining the importance of this truly global
issue and the vast interest of all relevant stakeholders, also to be included also in the
future.
Austria is convinced that the Netmundial Conference will offer an opportunity to facilitate
consensus in building upon the already existing documents adopted by different
stakeholders and international organizations, in particular the UN General Assembly and
the UN Human Rights Council, the OECD, the Council of Europe, the Brazilian Internet
Steering Committee and the Internet Rights and Principles Coalition.
The single, open, free and global Internet is essential for everyone, in full compliance with
human rights and fundamental freedoms, respect for the rule of law and basic conditions
for cybersecurity, in order to safeguard the social and economic potential of the Internet
for innovation, growth and unfolding the human potential in a democratic society.
Therefore, Austria recalls the WSIS outcome documents:
· the Geneva Declaration of Principles, reaffirming the universality, indivisibility,
interdependence and interrelation of all human rights and fundamental freedoms,
including the right to development, as enshrined in the Vienna Declaration; reaffirming
that democracy, sustainable development, and respect for human rights and fundamental
freedoms as well as good governance at all levels are interdependent and mutually
reinforcing; resolving to strengthen respect for the rule of law in international as in national
affairs; reaffirming Art. 19 and Art. 29 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights,
reaffirming the principles of freedom of the press and freedom of information, as well as
those of independence, pluralism and diversity of media,
· the Tunis Commitment, reaffirming par. 4,5 and 55 of the Geneva Declaration of
Principles, recognizing freedom of expression and free flow of information, ideas and
knowledge, essential for the Information Society and beneficial to development;
· the Tunis Agenda for the Information Society, in particular
- the continued security and stability of the Internet;
- the respect for the architectural principles of the Internet, including the global
interoperability, openness and the end-to-end principles;
- the need to promote effective competition in the global domain names market;
- the need to guarantee the principle of freedom of expression;
- the increased internationalization of Internet governance as a whole, and of
ICANN´s coordination and management of the domain name system in particular.
par. 31 recognizing that Internet Governance is an essential element for a
people- centered, inclusive, development-oriented and non-discriminatory Information
Society; committing to the stability and security of the Internet as a global facility
and to ensuring the requisite legitimacy of its governance, based on the full
participation of all stakeholders, from both developed and developing countries,
within their respective roles and responsibilities;
- among the documents adopted within the UN system, in particular:
the Resolution adopted by the Human Rights Council of the UN on 5 June 2012 on
promotion, protection and enjoyment of human rights on the Internet (A/HRC/20/8),
acknowledging the global and open nature of the Internet,
the GA-Resolution 68/167 “The rights of privacy in the digital age”, adopted by the UN
General Assembly on 18 December 2013 reaffirming the right to privacy, according to
which no one shall be subjected to arbitrary or unlawful interference with his/her privacy,
family, home or correspondence, and the right to the protection of the law against such
interference,
and
the Seoul Declaration for the future of the Internet Economy, adopted on 17/18 June
2008, calling for sustaining the open, decentralized and dynamic nature of the Internet,
interoperability, participation and ease of access,
Principles for Internet Policy-making, adopted by the OECD High Level Meeting on the
Internet Economy on 28/29 June 2011, and
the Internet Governance Strategy 2012-2015 of the Council of Europe.
We understand that reaching a consensus will provide a positive impetus for further
evolution within the UN system and within the Governmental Advisory Committee of
ICANN, in view of the extension of the Affirmation of Commitments regarding
IANA/ICANN.
