The Internet is changing lives all over the world.  Once connected, people have access to job opportunities, products, and services that were previously unthinkable.  People also rely on the Internet for entertainment and culture.  We know from recent studies that consumer demand for online content is skyrocketing, which is driving broadband deployment. To ensure continued and sustainable growth of the Internet, the entertainment and cultural industry supports a governance structure that:  

 

·         Benefits from meaningful participation by all interested parties, which requires that stakeholders share knowledge and information;

 

·         Fosters growth and innovation, which means systems must be interoperable and intellectual property rights protected; and

 

·         Ensures a safe, stable, and secure Internet supported by the rule of law and the sovereign rights of states, consistent with international norms and the principles of a free and democratic society.

 

These concepts stem from the 2005 Tunis Agenda for the Information Society.  While the foundation for these principles was laid in Africa, we look forward to continuing the dialog in South America at the Netmundial conference in Brazil, and to future discussions in other international fora.
