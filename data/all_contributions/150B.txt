Multistakeholderism

 

We would want to see articulation of a multistakholder framework that allows not only for participation and contribution into Internet policy and governance by all stakeholders, but also a reflection of the contributions in the final outcomes.

 

 

The process of internet public policy will need to be inclusive and transparent so that each stakeholder holds the same importance.

The final outcomes should be agreed on through enhanced cooperation by all regions.
