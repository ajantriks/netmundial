Recent years have witnessed the considerable progress achieved in developing and 
applying the latest information and telecommunication technologies, which could 
potentially be used for purposes that are inconsistent with the objectives of maintaining 
international stability and security. It is of great significance that the common challenges in 
the sphere of information security should be dealt with through international cooperation 
and in the spirit of mutual respect. To that end, China, Russia, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan 
have jointly elaborated in the form of a potential General Assembly resolution on an 
international code of conduct for information security and call for international 
deliberations within the United Nations framework on such an international code, with the 
aim of achieving the earliest possible consensus on international norms and rules guiding 
the behaviour of States in the information space (see annex).

The General Assembly,
Recalling its resolutions on the role of science and technology in the context of 
international security, in which, inter alia, it recognized that scientific and technological 
developments could have both civilian and military applications and that progress in 
science and technology for civilian applications needed to be maintained and encouraged,

latest information technologies and means of telecommunication,

combating the criminal misuse of information technologies and, in that context, stressing 
the role that can be played by the United Nations and other international and regional 
organizations,

need to protect the Internet and other information and communications technology 
networks from threats and vulnerabilities, and reaffirming the need for a common 
understanding of the issues of Internet security and for further cooperation at the national and international levels,Reaffirming that policy authority for Internet-related public issues is the sovereign right of 
States, which have rights and responsibilities for international Internet-related public policy 
issues,

technologies are among the main pillars of the information society and that a robust global

entitled “Creation of a global culture of cybersecurity and taking stock of national efforts to 
protect critical information infrastructures”,

transfer of information technology and capacity-building to developing countries in the 
areas of cybersecurity best practices and training, pursuant to resolution 64/211,
