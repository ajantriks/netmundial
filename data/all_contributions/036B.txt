From 28th to 30th August 2013, was held in Kinshasa – Democratic Republic of Congo, The 2nd Forum on Internet Governance in Central Africa, under the theme: "Governance the Internet for a harmonious development and sustainable ".

 

Five subjects were debate:

 

1.       Security and Cybercrime

2.       Protection and user rights on the internet

3.       Critical Internet resource

4.       Content, Media and citizens' initiatives

5.       Assessment and prospects

 

During the forum, participants have contributed and enriched the discussions. From these discussions it springs following recommendations that I would that the meeting Net Mundial 2014 considers too:

 

1. The need for involvement of the media to contribute to the awareness on the issues of ICT and use their privilege fourth power to influence the decision.

2. The need for Governments to host servers national locally.

3. The need to generate dynamic in Central Africa to bring governments, the private sector and CSOs pose and solve all the problems of the sector ICT in Central Africa.

4. Undertake advocacy for the right to be recognized internet in the Charter of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.

6. Conduct advocacy for the use of the Internet and ICTs contribute to the fight against girls and women violence

7. Conduct advocacy for the establishment of exchange points national, regional and sub-regional and encourage Governments to get involved in the process of instead.

8. Promote the development of local content to enjoy autonomy of cultural heritage

 

I take this opportunity to express some concerns regarding the governance of the global Internet.

Is a single body necessary or sufficient for governance of Internet?

I think that the role of the US government and concerned that ICANN is not fully representative of all stakeholders and so there is not transparency in ICANN.

There are two options for ICANN’s future. The first is to place some of its functions under the authority of an intergovernmental body like the UN or the ITU, an idea originally proposed at the WSIS. The second is to give it independent private sector status, with international multistakeholder input; I prefer the last option, because Intergovernmental body (UN or ITU) proofed their limit about their roles. Internet’s success largely is due to private sector involvement, and multistakeholder control may stifle innovation and investment.

Besides ICANN, several organizations play a role in developing internet policies and standards including:

 

- The Internet Society (ISOC), an international membership organization, responsible through groups such as the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) for developing internet technical standards.

- The World Wide Web Consortium, open to subscribing organizations, which develops technical standards and guidelines for the World Wide Web.

- The International Telecommunications Union (ITU) is a UN agency responsible for a wide range of telecommunication matters, including technical standards and development activities.

- Various international organizations such as the World Trade Organization and the World Intellectual Property Organization.                                                                                      

I think, those organizations had to play more and important role in a new process of Internet Governance.
