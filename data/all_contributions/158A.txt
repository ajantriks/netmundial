Abstract
As the result of an analysis of the existing charters or statements on Internet governance
principles, the undersigned Brazilian civil society organizations, committed to the
development of the Internet and its use for advancing social and economic justice, have
identified both APC Internet Rights Charter (2006) and Internet Rights and Principles
Coalition Charter (Charter of Human Rights and Principles for the Internet - 2011) as the
more comprehensible and important compilation of principles to address the need to
reinforce the protection of fundamental human rights in the internet. To move forward in
the debate of principles, we have been doing an exercise to merge both Charters of
principles and also update them, concerning current challenges for "the perspective of the
Internet as a global platform for social, economic and human development and a catalyzer
to exercise human rights." The result of this merging exercise is just as follows.

As the result of an analysis of the existing charters or statements on Internet governance
principles, the undersigned Brazilian civil society organizations, committed to the
development of the Internet and its use for advancing social and economic justice, have
identified both APC Internet Rights Charter (2006) and Internet Rights and Principles
Coalition Charter (Charter of Human Rights and Principles for the Internet - 2011) as the
more comprehensible and important compilation of principles to address the need to
reinforce the protection of fundamental human rights in the internet.
Both letters re-endorse the government commitments from reached during the WSIS
process, and clearly expressed in the Tunis Agenda and in the Geneva Declaration of
Principles and Plan of Action, both considered fundamental to address the need to "build
an inclusive development-oriented Information Society." They also can be endorsed as a
clear exercise on how to relate the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) to the
Internet and its governance. Therefore should serve as the basis to address the challenge
proposed by NETmundial to "identify a set of universal Internet Governance Principles to
be promoted as a global inspiration for the evolution of the Internet worldwide".
Nevertheless, it is important to highlight that all this rights can only be implemented and
enforced if the institutional environment for Internet Governance enables not only a
transparent, accessible and accountable decision making process - including those
pertaining technical standards - but also allows effective participation of representatives
from all the different stakeholder groups, in it's wide diversity, concerning region, culture,
gender, etc. Further developments on this institutional framework for the evolution of
Internet Governance Ecosystem will also be presented by this group in that particular
section for content submission at this same platform from NetMundial.
To move forward in the debate of principles, we have been doing an exercise to merge
both Charters of principles and also update them, concerning current challenges for "the
perspective of the Internet as a global platform for social, economic and human
development and a catalyzer to exercise human rights."
The result of this merging exercise is just as follows:
Set of Universal Internet Governance Principles to be promoted as a global
inspiration for the evolution of the internet worldwide
1. Right to digital inclusion and access to internet
Access is an enabler of fundamental human rights, and it should be seen beyond the right
to have connectivity, it should include the idea of digital inclusion, which means have the
right to develop skills to shape the internet to meet people’s need, which should be
achieved by securing the:
right to universal access, including the right to access to infrastructure
irrespective of where you live;
right to quality of service: standard minimum speed, signal or connection
stability, same bandwidth for uploads and downloads, net neutrality,
reliably customer services;
right to affordable access, addressing monopoly practices and final users
taxes;
right to public access, such as “telecentros” or digital cities practices;
right to internet at the workplace, without content restrictions and privacy
guarantee;
right to integrated and inclusive public policies on education, culture and
training on technology, which should not mean training just for a specific
software or application;
2. Right to net neutrality and openness
The principle of net neutrality implies that all Internet traffic is treated in an isonomic way,
ie, without discrimination based on content, device, author, source or destination of the
content, service or application. Connection providers or governments should not be
allowed to use its control over the Internet infrastructure or its market power to block,
prioritize, slowing access to certain content, applications or services, such as the
transmission to peer-to-peer. That means we should ensure:
right to end-to-end principle: no inspection on content packs should be
allowed;
right to open architecture: the internet as a ‘network of networks’ is made
up of many interconnected networks, based on the key underlying
technical idea of open architecture networking, in which any type of
network anywhere can be included and made publicly available;
right to open standards;
right to decentralized, collaborative and interoperable internet.
3. Access to Knowledge and Right to Culture
The internet has enabled the access to cultural good and knowledge in a way never seen
before, a characteristic that can serve as basis for sustainable human development.
As such, we should protect the:
Right to education through and about the Internet;
Right to knowledge commons and public domain: publicly funded research
and intellectual and cultural work must be available freely to the general
public;
Right to share information and knowledge in a way consistent with an
open and free participation in scientific and cultural life of the community;
Right to free and open source software (FOSS) choice;
Right to open technological standards;
Right to benefit from the convergence of media technologies.
4. Freedom of expression and association
The right to Freedom of expression is to seek, receive and impart information and ideas
through the internet,to guarantee it online, everyone should have the:
Right to freedom from censorship;
Right to freedom of the media;
Right to safe harbor for intermediaries in order to avoid censorship;
Right to engage in online protest;
Right to freedom from hate speech;
Right to participation in assembly and association on the internet;
Right to access of public information, which should be available in
compatible, open and interoperable formats;
Right to online participation in public affairs and electronic government;
5. Privacy, surveillance and encryption

surveillance practice shall be abide by principles of necessity and proportionality.

services;
Right to Freedom from Surveillance and from bulk collection of Internet
communication records;
Right to use Encryption;
Right to anonymity;
Right to standards of confidentiality and integrity of IT-Systems (no
backdoors).
6. Diversity and Non-Discrimination
Although the internet is a only one net, it should be open and inclusive, respecting the:
Right to access and create content that is culturally and linguistically
diverse;
Right to equal access for men and women;
Right to accessibility: interfaces, content and applications accessible to
all, including people with physical, sensory or cognitive disabilities, people
who are not literate an people who speak minority languages;
Right to equal access for marginalized groups, including elderly, young
people, ethnic minorities;

foster realization of rights. That means:

Right to recourse when rights are violated;
Right to fair trial and due process in relation to legal claims regarding the
internet.
