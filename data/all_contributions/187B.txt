Summary
The «Tunis Agenda " , outcome of the second phase of the World Summit on the Information Society ( Tunis 2005 ), has set the basics of the Internet Governance by defining the roles of the various stakeholders.
Tunisia considers that governments have a role in safeguarding the public interest which gives them specific responsibilities of Internet governance: cybersecurity, compliance with the law, the protection of human rights, freedoms fundamentals, intellectual property and cultural and linguistic diversity, etc.
Thus, it is necessary to deepen the issues of Internet regulation and interactions between technical considerations and public policy related to the Internet governance.
Thus, the Internet governance must respect the following principles:
? Free, universal and affordable access to information
? Respect Human Rights including freedom of expression
? Protection of privacy
? Protection of the neutrality on the net
? Improving the cultural and linguistic diversity
The roadmap for the further evolution of the Internet governance ecosystem must be in accordance with these principles and should aim to the internationalization of the institutions managing the critical resources in order to insure better coordination of technical agencies while strengthening the role governments with regard to their responsibilities.
Moreover, the Globalization cannot be ensured without a strong stakeholder involvement in technology transfer, capacity building and access to funding for developing countries.

The Global Multistakeholder Meeting on the Future of Internet Governance «NETMUNDIAL " to be held in Sao Paulo (Brazil) on 23-24 April 2014 with main objectives the identification and promotion of a Set of universal Internet Governance principles and the roadmap for the further evolution of the Internet governance ecosystem in order to act as a plate-form supporting the Internet catalytic role in the social, economic and human development.
The Tunisian Government proposes the following contribution on the " Internet Governance principles " and the " Roadmap for the further evolution of the Internet governance ecosystem "
- The principles on Internet governance, as set in the two phases of the World Summit on the Information Society (Geneva 2003 - Tunis 2005) and mainly in the " Tunis Agenda " states that “the Internet has evolved into a global facility available to the public and its governance should constitute a core issue of the Information Society agenda. The international management of the Internet should be multilateral, transparent and democratic, with the full involvement of governments, the private sector, civil society and international organizations "remains the basis for multi-stakeholder, democratic and transparent future Internet governance.
- Governments as a public authority in charge of public Internet policy must ensure public interest objectives identified as to permit compliance with the Law and the protection of human rights, fundamental freedoms and democratic values as well as intellectual property and linguistic and cultural diversity. This authority is formalized by the establishment of a technically solid, innovative and secures architecture able to strengthen the trust of Internet users.
- Giving the nature of the Internet as an ecosystem in which each party shall bear its responsibilities, it is necessary to deepen appropriate approaches to self-regulation and co-regulation on the Internet, as a complement to regulatory framework, while ensuring the respect and enforcement of the fundamental rights, transparency, accountability and inclusion of all stakeholders.
- The establishment of technical specifications in a multi-stakeholder approach should be based on effective reciprocal interactions between technical considerations and public policy concerns.
- Trust in the Internet and its governance is a prerequisite for realizing the potential of the Internet as an engine of economic growth and innovation. This trust is established by transparent governance, open, balanced and responsible with respect to the following dimensions:
? Free, universal and affordable access to information,
? Protect Human Rights including freedom of expression,
? Provisions for privacy,
? Protection of net neutrality,
? Improving the cultural and linguistic diversity.
These principles should supply the concrete roadmap for the future development of the ecosystem of Internet governance by identifying the roles and mandates for each stakeholder in the implementation of future action plans.
Considering that The Internet is a global infrastructure, a better global balance among the existing organizations and institutions can increase the legitimacy of governance mechanisms. This balance can be achieved through the agreement between stakeholders in order to achieve the following objectives:
- Accelerating the globalization of the IANA and ICANN, while preserving the continued stability and security of the domain name system.
- Further strengthen the role of the GAC in the ICANN process of decision
- Enabling the IGF forums to develop mechanisms for better implementation of its results
- Develop a global model, fair and transparent for the management of critical Internet resources, which is a global public good, including root server names and numbers.
- Promoting the coordination on the results of meetings organized by various international bodies (UNCTAD , ITU, ICANN , IGF ... ) grouping the stakeholders on the future development of the global Internet governance .
- Strengthen national sovereignty under international treaties and the respect the privacy of users.
- Invite stakeholders to develop mechanisms and programs to facilitate technology transfer and capacity building for developing countries, especially in the areas of network technologies and security, as well as regulatory framework and regulation.
- In order to bridge the digital divide stakeholders are encouraged to implement programs and funding mechanisms that can help developing countries to expand access to the Internet at affordable for their citizens.
