Bulgarian Contribution on "Internet Governance Principles" and  "Roadmap for the Further Evolution  of the Internet Governance Ecosystem" as set out in the goals for International Multistakeholder meeting on Internet Governance in Sao Paulo, Brazil, on 23/24 of April 2014

 

Bulgaria supports the efforts of the European Commission to formulate a common position and concept encompassing the main principles for the development, management and governance of the Internet as a major resource for innovation and prosperity, including

 

• The Internet should remain one single unfragmented space, where all resources should be accessible in the same manner, irrespective of the location of the user and the provider

 

• Internet-related discussions and decisions should be based on a strengthened, genuine multi-stakeholder model.

 

• The technical architecture of the Internet has been able to evolve to cope with new and often unforeseen challenges

 

• Confidence in the Internet and its governance is a prerequisite for the realisation of the Internet's potential as an engine for economic growth and innovation

 

• Bulgaria supports the view that the Internet must allow freedom of expression and respect for human rights- fundamental  principles  to democratic societ?

 

Setting the process of globalization of the Internet Governance is one of the most important issues for discussion.

 

Regarding the process related to the globalization of Internet Governance, so as to enable the active participation of national governments, we recommend a serious discussion to be scheduled, in order to provide a critical evaluation of the effect arising from the process, to assess the potential outcomes as well as to prevent retreat of the security, privacy and interoperability criteria.

 

It is considered a good approach to expand the circle of stakeholders in order to stimulate the elaboration of policies on the Information Society and we admire the idea of ??establishing a platform as a Global Internet Policy Observatory (GIPO) on policies regarding the Internet as a suitable form of innovative online resource.

 

As far as the roadmap is concerned  we believe that realistic guidelines can be drawn only after a discussion in Sao Paulo since all aspects of the discussed problem on the extent of transformation as well as the time period of the process will be clarified  there

 

Bulgaria is ready to participate in upcoming discussions.
