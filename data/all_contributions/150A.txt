Abstract
Stakeholders are agreed that there is need for consideration of different views from the
different stakeholders in the realm of internet governance. However there is no framework
that ensures the views are taken on board and ultimately reflected in final outcomes.

Multistakeholderism
We would want to see articulation of a multistakholder framework that allows not only for
participation and contribution into Internet policy and governance by all stakeholders, but
also a reflection of the contributions in the final outcomes.
The process of internet public policy will need to be inclusive and transparent so that each
stakeholder holds the same importance.
The final outcomes should be agreed on through enhanced cooperation by all regions.
Multinationals
Internet grip by undemocratic giant private multinationals continually acquiring or killing
emerging competition and innovations should also be told off. We have recent evidence of
such corporations going into bed with governments to achieve their mutual interests.
