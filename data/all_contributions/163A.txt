Abstract
The network operators community from Latin America and The Caribbean (LACNOG)
agreed on a set of principles related with their business and developed on a consensus
based process.
Document
* The management of Internet Resources (IPs, ASNs, DNS, etc.) must follow a set of
rules defined by all the parts involved in their utilization including network operators,
users, content provider, and other organizations that need those Internet resources for
their operation.
* The problems and technical practices on the Internet that can be addressed through
operational changes or network management over the IP networks must be documented
and agreed by the community as Best Current Operational Practices (BCOPs or BCPs).
Changes on networking equipment should not be imposed by regulations. Lacnog, as a
community aimed to discuss Internet operation issues, firmly believe on the open,
cooperative and collaborative development of such documents and processes.
* The interconnection of Networks and Internet traffic exchange among network operators
should be encouraged, promoted and agreed between the interested parties. Regulations
should be minimised or avoided in order to promote interconnections and intervention is
only advisable when there are barriers fo such interconnections.
* The groups and Internet governance bodies to be created should include appropriate
representation from network operator groups.
