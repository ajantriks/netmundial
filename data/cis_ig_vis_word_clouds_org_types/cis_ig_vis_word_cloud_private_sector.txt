The US Treasury Department Blocked so many sites on the internet on a number of countries including Cuba  Iran and Sudan  As example  Google  Adobe  Macfee and other companies have blocked access to some services in fear of violating US laws which ban commerce with black-listed countries which Sudan is part of them  Which Violate PRINCIPLES FOR THE GOVERNANCE AND USE OF THE INTERNET? Neutrality of the network Filtering or traffic privileges must meet ethical and technical criteria only  excluding any political  commercial  religious and cultural factors or any other form of discrimination or preferential treatment 

List of blocked online Services and Web  Google earth  Google chrome  Google open code  Google download (Gtalk – Google gears - etc)  Most of the Antivirus websites (AVG  Mcafee  Norton     etc )  RealPlayer  Oracle  Adobe  JAVA – Sun Systems  Hosting companies (like godaddy)  Source forge  LinkedIN (business social network)  Most of the E-commerce activities  online payment (PayPal)  Not allowed to edit or own wikipedia pages  Sudanese are not allow to sit for online exams  For instance  MCSE or CISCO  No interaction services like video sharing and instant messaging 

Understanding threats is fundamental to enterprise risk management  threats need to be evaluated in thecontext of the organisation on to determine risk 
 
This year s Threat Horizon report fi nds that the biggest risk is from known threats  The fact that hacktivism and malicious software have been around for some it me doesn t mean they re less threatening and we can relax – quite the opposite  Known threats  because they ve matured  are more dangerous and pose more risk to our organisation ons than ever  They re more sophisticated and more effective  Whether they re old or new is much less important than their potential to do harm 
 
The annual ISF Threat Horizon report provides a practice cal way for organisations to take a forward-looking view of the increasing threats in today s always-on  interconnected world  This in turn enables a better prepared  strategic approach to managing and mitigating risk 
 
This year s report deals with the following themes 
 
• Cyber risk is challenging to understand and address  from CEOs that simply don t get it to organisati ons struggling to fi nd the right people 
 
• Reputation is a new target for cyber attacks  from insider activists who leak information  and hackativist collectives who vote on who they dislike this week
 
• Criminals value your information  they re highly motivated to obtain it  or to use what leaks out of your organisation
 
• The changing pace of technology doesn t help  bring your own cloud (BYOC) and bring your own device (BYOD) also bring their own risks
 
• The role of governments must not be misunderstood  while they have a key role to play  they won t lead cyber security eff orts – they expect organisations to manage risks in cyberspace and prevent information and systems from being compromised
 
ISF Threat Horizon reports are written for a non-technical audience  and ISF Members use them for many purposes  for example as a communications and awareness tool  to align business and security strategy  and to influence their organisation s risk appettite  This report contains recommendations and references to ISF influence on s te deliverables and other external resources which can helpaddress these risks 

The Internet Governance Coalition (the  Coalition ) extends our sincere appreciation to Brazil for hosting the  Global Multistakeholder Meeting on the Future of Internet Governance   to be held in São Paulo  The Meeting is taking place at a time when the topic of Internet governance is an issue of great interest around the world  The many major conferences and work efforts scheduled this year exemplify the accelerated pace of Internet governance discussions and make      a particularly important year in the ongoing evolution of the Internet  Indeed  there are a host of institutions  each with different core functions and strengths  that address issues related to Internet governance 

 

The Coalition represents leading international Internet and telecom companies  including  Amazon  AT&T  Inc   Cisco Systems  Inc   Comcast NBCUniversal  Google Inc   Juniper Networks Inc   Microsoft Corporation  Telefónica  S A   The Walt Disney Company  Time Warner Cable Inc   Twenty-First Century Fox Inc   and Verizon Communications Inc   We believe a thriving Internet depends on a governance structure that is open  transparent  and representative of all stakeholders  The multistakeholder model approach to Internet governance has allowed for the creation of decentralized structures that have resulted in historic economic  social  and political development  This decentralized structure of the Internet has enabled individuals to access information and services  to connect and to communicate  and to share ideas and knowledge globally  By offering new possibilities for entrepreneurial creativity  the Internet has become a powerful engine for technological innovation  economic growth  and the preservation and promotion of cultural diversity  We believe this model  strengthened as necessary  will continue to best serve these shared goals and Internet users far into the future   

 

These concepts are rooted in the      Tunis Agenda for the Information Society that provided the foundational principles for Internet governance  which affirmed the multistakeholder  transparent  and democratic governance of the Internet  while at the same time recognizing the sovereignty of governments and rule of law  It is precisely because of this multistakeholder governance model that the Internet has grown into the transformative platform it is today  To say nothing of the broader social benefits from the Internet  its economic contributions have been astonishing  According to McKinsey Global Institute  the Internet accounts for    percent of GDP growth in the last five years in developed countries  and in    surveyed developing countries  

 

We believe that preserving and advancing open and consultative decision-making is essential to ensuring that global citizens are able to take advantage of this transformative platform both now and in the future  As such  we support the following principles which we believe are essential to Internet governance 

 

·         Policies must ensure a safe  secure  open  interoperable  and sustainable Internet 

 

·         Policies must stimulate sustainable investment in and deployment of Internet networks and the industries and services that create demand for those networks 

 

·         Policies must support opening and maintaining international markets in a way that allows for the seamless flow of digital services  applications  products  and information 

 

·         Policies must foster innovation across Internet networks  services  and other sectors in the Internet ecosystem  including ensuring the protection of intellectual property 

 

·         Policies must support increased transparency and openness in intergovernmental organizations and multistakeholder mechanisms  to ensure that all stakeholders can participate meaningfully in key Internet policy discussions   The quality of Internet governance decisions increases when diverse stakeholders choose to actively and consistently participate 

 

·         Policies must support capacity building and implementation of best practices in relation to network security 

 

·         Policies must support the rule of law which governments have primary responsibility for advancing 

 

The Coalition looks forward to working with all stakeholders to prepare for a successful Meeting in Brazil  and welcomes this opportunity for dialogue on these important issues  International consensus on Internet policies is unlikely to be realized at only one meeting  These debates will continue at future meetings  including the      Internet Governance Forum  WSIS Review  and ITU Plenipotentiary  that  together with the  The Global Multistakeholder Meeting   promise to make significant contributions to the ongoing global dialogue on Internet governance  

 

The Coalition again extends its appreciation to the host country of Brazil and to CGI br and / net for their extraordinary and constructive work in organizing the Meeting 

 

 

  

Respectfully Submitted 

 

 

INTERNET GOVERNANCE COALITION

The vertiginous development of new Information and Communication Technology (ICT) in the past twenty years set the pace for a global technological revolution - comparable to the discovery of steam or the invention of electricity – which caused deep changes in society  Practically all areas in the realm of ICT have rapidly and deeply become an integral part of people's behaviors and perceptions in all social strata  thus configuring the features of the so-called Information Society 

 

This becomes manifest  on the one hand  in the changes experienced in the realms of work  education  media and online transactions  among others  Here is a case in point  it seems only natural that in today s world everyone should have a mobile phone  at least one TV set per household with access to channels from all over the world  instant access to almost any kind of online information and contact with people we have never met in person or on the phone  This situation was unheard of twenty years ago  today  it is our everyday reality 

 

ICT penetration has also had a strong impact both upon people's perception of their own place in contemporary society - leaving behind the concept of "country citizen" and embracing the idea of being a "citizen of the world" - an upon their own understanding of the Information Society  The new globalized world   visible and small" as depicted in mass media  new electronic communication devices and means of transport 

 

On the other hand  one of the core values enhanced and strengthened by ICT is  undoubtedly  the value of freedom  There is many an example of this  such as the possibility to liaise with anyone on this planet irrespective of where they are  engage in online business transactions with no time or location constraints  access information on any topic and share our own uncensored views on cyberspace with any interested stakeholders 

 

Of course  it almost goes without saying at this point that all of these advantages - and disadvantages - of the Internet are tied to a fundamental condition  i e  that all people have access to ICT  starting with a computer with online connectivity  In this sense  it is worth noting the compelling policy to bridge the digital gap currently implemented by the Dominican government to accomplish the social inclusion of all its citizens 

 

However  these certain possibilities of expanded individual and collective freedoms brought about by the Internet -and turned into State policies by governments - can also lead to the perception that the Web  just like any other tool  may also be used for purposes that are even contrary to those initially conceived upon its creation 

 

Although some technological devices are better regulated in terms of protecting children and minors  e g  there are children protection times on TV  movies are rated for different audiences according to their content  and minors may not engage in e-commerce transactions  the speed of Internet expansion and the multiplication of all kinds of web pages  applications and functions has outpaced the perception of implicit risks and - even worse - the measures put in place to prevent or fight them 

 

In terms of the issue at hand  this situation means that the protection of minors is  indeed  lagging behind  Although there are efforts in place to this end  the way in which the Web works makes it complex to put these measures into practice  be it because children sit in front of a computer by themselves  because access to all sites is free and subject to no restriction  or because there are people with a criminal intent at the other end  We should not overlook the lack of interest and knowledge on the part of parents and teachers regarding the way the Internet and online platforms are operated  It is fundamental to create content to reach out to this audience as well 

 

In view of the prior considerations  the main reason underlying the absence of actions to prevent and fight cybercrime targeting children and minors is the overall lack of knowledge in the adult and youth populations  Hence  the main beneficiaries of policies to prevent and fight these crimes must be the parents of children and teenagers  since they are the ones with the concrete possibility to make their children understand this situation  and implement the necessary prevention and control measures 

From my personal perspective  thinking about the basic principles of IG should firstly answer three questions 

 

 ) What kind of Cyberspace or information society do we really want ?

 

 ) What are these major threats or challenges (existing or potential) to Cyberspace or information sociaty we want ?

 

 ) What kind of IG idiom or philosophy and related IG Mechanism can deal with effectively these threats and challenges ?

 

According to thoughts and answers to these questions (for the limitation of characters  I would not deploy specific analyse here)  maybe we can take these principles into consideration 

 

 ) Principle of Harmony

It has two tiers of meanings  one is "safe"  the other is "coexist"  it not only describe a kind of static status  but also a kind of dynamic interaction  All the actors  state  civil sociaty and individual should feel safe and comfortable sharing the same place and contribute to the prosperous of entire human sociaty  It's the ultimate target of IG 

 

 ) Principle of development

IG should do all efforts of make sure the development of internet and cyberspace and keep the essence of Internet  "open and free"  on the other side anyone or anything could hinder the development of internet and cyberspace should be punished and stopped  It's the main tast of IG 

 

 ) Principle of justice

The world is unequal  but we should not let it be especially in cyberspace and make efforts to make it become a better space where everyone has same right  the stonger should take responsible for their behavior and the weaker should has the opportunity to keep them safe and have the opportunity to make progress It's the focous of IG 

 

 ) Principle of efficiency

Not ony efficient to keep the internet work well and make consistant development  but also efficient to make reform to change some inappropriate stato quo  It's the emergency of IG 

 

 ) Principle of dynamics

Things change quick and IG should keep dynamic mechnism to cope with  IG should be open to all options only if needed  It's the neccesary of IG  All these are just brief thinking of principles of IG  i look forward to communicate with experts and scholars worldwide and share their wisdom  and make common contributions to the milestone event of internet goernance 

AfICTA Submission to the Global Multistakeholder Meeting on the Future of Internet Governance – The NETmundial
Sao Paulo  Brazil  April   -        
The NETmundial is focused on getting globally acceptable PRINCIPLES for Internet Governance and evolving frameworks for further evolution of the Internet 
AfICTA and its members appreciate the opportunity presented by the hosts of NETmundial and look forward to active participation in this worthwhile process 
AfICTA supports and promotes the following PRINCIPLES to be adopted for effective governance of the Internet 
   DO NO HARM  by ensuring and assuring that the Internet - and its ecosystem  is not disrupted as a transformational tool for socio-economic development and the protection of rights of users of the Internet 
   OPENNESS  through promoting universal  non-discriminatory and affordable access to the Internet  Poor and remote users must not be disadvantaged 
   ACCOUNTABILITY  through democratic and transparent processes involving all stakeholders  creating an environment of fair and appropriate standards  regulations and legislation 
   AWARENESS AND KNOWLEDGE SHARING  supporting innovation  interoperation and functionality 
   FREEDOM to use the Internet for benign purposes by any individual  community  organisation or enterprise
AfICTA further submits that the ROADMAP for further evolution of the Internet can only happen when the following are in place 
   Constructive and continuous engagement  which is happening already in IGF  CSTD and is expected at NETmundial
   Equal participation of all stakeholders in the Internet Future debates
   Empowerment of effective participation of stakeholders from developing and least developed economies  which will mean financial support for representatives of all categories of stakeholders
   Recognition that existing multistakeholder institutions have contributed to the Internet s global growth and need to remain at the heart of the Internet governance ecosystem
   Governments should commit to a single  interoperable Internet that can flourish globally  enabling freedom of expression and economic prosperity 
   Commitment to collaborate with the private sector toward prevention of crime and protection of individuals at the global level  including support for national adoption of rule of law  cooperative mechanism to address risks and threats on the Internet  We must recognise that the Internet has created new types of economic and personal crime  Government and the private sector need to collaborate to support improved mechanism to address risks and threats while educating users about their responsibilities and rights 
The expected resultant effect is CONFIDENCE  STABILITY  SECURITY and RESILIENCY of the Internet for continuous socio-economic development that can serve the     billion users  and support the inclusion of the next  + billion users 

We believe for the Internet to remain a source for the good then it is vital that the Governance Principles are fully supported by all the stakeholders with a proper consensus  The Internet is evolving rapidly and if the principles are too specific and detailed then they become out of date very quickly as society changes as well as the technology  It is better for the principles to be high level rather than just a long list of detailed statements which will be less effective  We have seen examples in the past where this has happened and as a result they have not attracted support from some stakeholders  If possible we should aim for a genuine Global consensus that is capable of being flexible to the changing needs of the stakeholders and their roles  If we don t then we risk stifling innovation  

 

techUK fully supports the continuing use of the multi stakeholder model recognising that it will continue to evolve to remain fit for purpose  It should also be able to take on the needs of countries who have less resources to allow the developing world to grow  Rural and remote communities worldwide will benefit from the internet and it is incumbent on the developed nations to help support these aims  Here in Europe market liberalisation has brought enormous benefits which we would like to see replicated in all parts of the world which in turn will allow growth to benefit all  

 

We do not see a need for the creation of a single international organisation as internet problems are perfectly well taken care of in existing organisations such as the WTO and others  This allows stakeholders to have their concerns addressed using existing processes via existing organisations  

 

It is vital that a single internet is retained as fragmentation and localism would seriously undermine the economic and social benefits we draw from it today  We should also recognise however that the network architecture of the internet is changing with far less traffic being  routed through the US than was hitherto the case  This is not a bad thing and it improves the traffic management as local hubs begin to appear in place of high traffic concentration  ICANN is reflecting these changes and techUK supports this  We also believe that ICANN should remain a technical organisation and should not stray into areas of politics and policy   

 

Finally to repeat again the multi stakeholder model is vital to the future wellbeing of the internet and changes should be resisted unless everyone can see major benefits in them

Telecom Italia Group s Submission for NETmundial
(  March     )
Abstract 
Telecom Italia Group is pleased to provide this submission on Global Internet Governance
Principles and a Roadmap for the further evolution of the Internet governance ecosystem to the
Global Multistakeholder Meeting on the Future of Internet Governance  to be held   -   April
     in San Paolo  Brazil
Introduction
Telecom Italia Group (hereafter TI) welcomes the opportunity to participate to the  Global Multistakeholder
Meeting on the Future of Internet Governance  or NETmundial  We acknowledge the
leading role that  since the WTPF of       the government of Brazil is playing  in the Internet
governance arena  by calling this meeting  We would like to contribute to this event through our
participation to the discussion of Internet Governance Principles and of the evolution of the multistakeholder
model for the future of Internet governance 
The meeting s agenda is focused on two issues 
   Internet Governance Principles
   Roadmap for the Further Evolution of the Internet Governance
Telecom Italia submits contributions on both issues 
Internet Governance Principles
Internet is today at the center of the economic activity and social life of enterprises and citizens 
Every day it becomes more important and more pervasive thanks to the massive investment in
infrastructure made by the telcos  the hundreds of thousands of applications and services made
available by the internet ecosystem of companies and developers  the development of high speed
mobile internet access  cloud computing and ubiquitous computing  We no longer need to go on
the internet because we live in the Internet  Internet has been a remarkable success and Telecom
Italia believes that this historical result has been to a large extent a consequence of the
unregulated nature of this technology 
Contrary to the past  the economics and the technology of Internet call today for more variety and
Internet differentiation  While this process has been present for quite some time  it is today more
visible  for instance  in the multi-lingual diversification of Internet  Recently  the Internet
Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) announced that the first new generic Top-
Level Domains (gTLDs) in Arabic  Cyrillic and Chinese from its new gT LD Program were delegated 
A more heterogeneous and diversified Internet might alarm many in the Internet community 
Instead this process is quite desirable  Quite often we talk about the Internet as an ecosystem  but
we forget that in any ecosystem a high degree of diversity is vital for the overall health and
resilience of the system 
At the same time  TI believes that the Internet needs to be governed by a coherent set of
principles shared by all stakeholders from various sector- business  government and civil society 
These principles should be based on a broad and open debate characterized by a constitutional
effort and should encompass an overarching framework of universal values shared by the internet
community  The San Paolo meeting could be a step in this direction  There is already a significant
amount of work done to develop Internet governance principles by different organizations and
players  The OECD Council Recommendations on Principles for Internet Policymaking or the
Brazilian Internet Steering Committee s (CGI br) are some good examples 
Among these principles  TI particularly supports 
? Promoting safe  secure  open  reliable and interoperable Internet
? Strengthening consistency and effectiveness in privacy protection at a global level
? Promoting policies that stimulate sustainable investments and deployment of Internet
networks
? Endorsing policies that increase transparency  openness   accountability and inclusiveness
in the Internet Governance process
Possibly  one of the goals of San Paolo s meeting should be the recognition that these principles
should be shared and considered as common principles by all the stakeholders of the meeting 
Roadmap for the Further Evolution of the Internet Governance
The technological and economic environment of Internet has dramatically changed since the mid-
    s  making Internet much more diverse and dynamic than in the past  According to the most
recent literature  four major changes have forced the networks to evolve since then 
 ) Increase in the number and diversity of end users  from a small population of scientists
and researchers to a user base much larger  more diverse and less technologically
sophisticated 
  See on this Christopher Yoo (    )   The Dynamic Internet How technologies  Users and Businesses Are
Transforming the Network   AEI  
 ) Increase in the diversity and intensity of applications  from low intensity bandwidth
applications such as email and web-browsing to videoconferencing  to online gaming which
is much more bandwidth intensive 
 ) Increase in the variety of technologies  while in the mid-  s access to the Internet was
granted through dial-up modems  now access is guaranteed through a variety of
technologies such as cable modems  digital subscriber lines (DSL)  fiber to the home and
wireless solutions  These new technologies have different characteristics in terms of
bandwidth  reliability and mobility  bringing a substantial degree of heterogeneity in the
Internet world compared to the uniformity of the wireline solutions of the mid-  s
 ) The emergence of more complex business relationships  In the mid-  s  the topology of
the Internet was characterized by a strict three-level hierarchy  backbones  regional
Internet service providers and last mile access providers  Now the Internet  as a network of
networks  is characterized by a set of much more diverse business relationships such as  for
instance  private peering and content delivery networks 
These technological and economic changes have placed increasing pressures on the Internet and
in  particular  are leading  among other characteristics  towards 
 ) changes in the optimal level of standardization to match the greater demand for
heterogeneity 
 ) the shift towards more formal governance to manage the increase in the number and
heterogeneity of end users 
 ) the migration of functions into the core of the network for a better management of
security and congestion 
 ) the growing complexity of internet pricing to support the new business relations of today
Internet 
These technological and economic changes over the past fifteen-plus years have made Internet a
much more dynamic and heterogynous environment and are placing increasing pressures on the
Internet to develop new architectural principles to cope with these new dynamics and to the
Internet governance process to envisage new models able to better match governance issues with
the right governance institutions 
The diffusion of cross layers architecture for the mobile Internet is a case in point that shows that
when circumstances have changed sufficiently  the network architecture needs to change 
Protocol layering has always been at the heart of Internet and coherence with the layered stack
has always characterized Internet architecture  Protocol layering has also find an ad hoc space
into the discussion of Internet Policy when  it has been suggested that lower layers of the Internet
should be subjected to regulation while upper layers should be exempted from it  The weakness of
this approach has been later on shown by the regulatory intervention on some parts of the
networks only such as the last mile but not the backbone or by the recent awareness that market
power is also possible in the upper layers as the latest antitrust cases against Microsoft and
Google have demonstrated  
It is clear the need to diverge from the traditional protocol layering assumptions in order to face
the challenges from a more dynamic and heterogynous Internet driven by mobile applications 
Against this backdrop  TI believes that it is necessary to examine the current status of the Internet
governance  of the institutions currently involved in this process and assess how the Internet
governance should evolve capitalizing on the strength of the past experiences and aiming at
fostering an open and inclusive Internet 
Towards a multi-stakeholder model with variable geometry
TI recognizes that the multi-stakeholder model has been an important factor for the success of the
Internet  However  TI believes that the multi-stakeholder model while worked efficiently in ad hoc
technical organizations  it requires a completely different effort to be successful when it is applied
to global policy making   The open nature of the multi-stakeholder process does not guarantee by
itself an effective participation of all stakeholders  Indeed  participation today has become the
main principle of any form of Internet governance  This process  sometimes called  participatory
evangelism   offers people opportunities to get involve but not to really count in the decision
making process  Indeed  there is an important distinction between making your views known and
making your views counts   Analogous considerations can be made regarding the transparency of
the multi-stakeholder process  Quite often information overload characterizes meetings and fora
of the multi-stakeholder process creating real difficulties in identifying really important issues 
Furthermore  different risks of capture by different groups ( Internet evangelists  or
  Today  to ensure reliability modern wireless broadband network increasingly deploy network-based reliability
systems  such as Automatic Repeat request(ARQ)  that shift functions traditionally performed by the transport layer
into either the data-link layer or routers operating in the core  clearly diverging from the TCP/IP reference model  See
on this   Christopher Yoo   Protocol Layering and Internet Policy   University of Pennsylvania Law School Research
Paper n         
  See on this  Bertrand de la Chapelle (    )  Internet Policy Making  MIND   Furthermore  see IGP (    ) ICANN  Inc 
Accountability and participation in the governance of critical Internet Resources  
representatives from developed countries in the IGF or in the GAC within ICANN  or the private
sector) have been suggested in the current process  Therefore  a stronger effort is required by all
parties to improve and make more successful this process 
At the same time  TI believes that it is necessary to recognize that today new dynamics exist
among the stakeholders of the Internet governance process  There are few significant examples
of such a change  The more active role that governments want to play on internet governance
issues is a recent trend that is here to stay  The powerful role multiple stakeholders can play in
the internet governance arena  it suffice to mention the massive online boycott launched by
Internet technologies companies and civil society as a response to the two proposed bills in the
US  the SIPA and the PIPA  
This new dynamic among stakeholders associated with an overall increase of Internet
differentiation brought by the economic and technological changes of the Internet of the last   
years  suggest that it is increasing difficult that one single governance regime could address the
broad range of concerns associated with today s Internet 
Searching for a unitary governance framework could lead only towards an undesirable least
common denominator  What is needed is to allow for a better match between governance issues
and the best governance institutions available  Therefore  TI suggests that the current system of
governance should allow for a stronger interplay among the different actors in the internet
governance arena  Therefore  TI envisages the evolution of the current multi-stakeholder model
towards a multi-stakeholder model with variable geometry 
This approach should be seen as an evolution from the current institutions  In the current multistakeholder
model a distinction between the concepts of shared and equal responsibility  should
be made  While all stakeholders need to participate in the multi stakeholder model on equal
footing when the different governance issues and governance institutions are envisaged and
discussed  then in the implementation of the governance process one stakeholder or a coalition of
stakeholders (variable geometry) could take the lead in this process according to the nature of
the governance issue at stake  standards (the private sector)  Internet issues relevant to particular
communities (civil society)  human rights (government) 
  Stop Online Piracy Act  (SOPA) and the  Preventing Real Online Threats to Economic Creativity and Theft of
Intellectual Property Act  (PROTECT IP Act or PIPA)  See on this Laura De Nardis (    )    The Global War for Internet
Governance   Yale University Press  pag    SOPA Stop
The matching process could also be facilitated by the creation of an ad hoc committee that  based
on a multi-stakeholder membership  could suggest the most suitable governance institution  
Therefore  this process  based on the variable leading role of the different actors  should allow for
a better match of each type of governance challenge with the best governance institution 
Elements of a roadmap from the San Paolo Meeting
TI recommends that the San Paolo s meeting makes concrete steps towards 
 ) A roadmap for the revision and the reinforcement of the multi-stakeholder model
according to the previously suggested variable geometry approach 
 ) A clear timeline to globalize ICANN and IANA functions that safeguards the stability 
security and resilience of the Internet 
 ) A commitment to strengthen the role of the Global Internet Governance Forum according
to 
a  Mainstreaming the content and the proposals discussed at the Global Forum to the
other Internet Governance institutions to enhance its impact on global Internet
governance and policy 
b  Making stronger the interactions between the Global IGF and the national and
regional IGF to allow for a more inclusive process of participation and discussion 
c  Designing mechanisms for a better funding of the Global IGF 

To Whom It May Concern 

Established in       the U S  Section of the Brazil-U S  Business Council (Brazil Council) is the premier business advocacy organization dedicated to strengthening the economic and commercial relationship between Brazil and the United States  representing more than     of the top U S  companies with investments in Brazil  The U S  Chamber of Commerce (U S  Chamber)  the world s largest business federation representing the interests of more than three million businesses of all sizes  sectors  and regions  as well as state and local chambers and industry associations  and dedicated to promoting  protecting  and defending America s free enterprise system   The U S  Chamber and the Brazil Council greatly appreciate the opportunity to provide content for the  Global Multi-stakeholder Meeting on the Future of Internet Governance   or NETmundial and looks forward to active participation during the meeting on April   -    

We applaud the efforts of the Brazilian government to coordinate the engagement of a broad group of stakeholders to discuss such an important topic  

The Internet represents one of the greatest engines for growth  providing benefits across regions and levels of development  It is the great equalizer  providing businesses of all sizes the opportunity to access the billions of consumers outside of their physical location and to compete on the quality of products offered  The Internet allows consumers  educators  and health providers alike the ability to access the best products and technology and to share information throughout the world  

This all depends on a governance structure that is open  transparent  and representative of all stakeholders  The current multistakeholder model approach to Internet governance has fulfilled these needs while creating a decentralized structure that fueled rapid development around the world   

In order to ensure that global growth and prosperity continue  we respectfully offer the following principles to serve as a core for Internet governance 

•Policies must maintain a bottom-up approach that allows for robust and meaningful input from all stakeholders  

•Policies must be future proof and technology neutral  able to accommodate rapidly developing technology and different types of uses and sectors  

•Policies need to promote a voluntary  global system of standing setting  

•Policies should facilitate the stability  security  interoperability  and functionality of the underlying network structure 

•Policies must support the seamless flow of digital services  applications  products and information  

The roadmap for the future of Internet governance must incorporate the above policy concerns while also maintaining its flexibility to adapt  One of the great strengths of the inclusive governance model is the ability to nimbly and quickly address fast moving technological changes  The future of Internet governance must avoid codifying rigid rules or a top-down system  which only causes bottlenecking for decisions and makes it more difficult for a wide-spectrum of stakeholders to participate freely  

By ensuring  the above principles and following the suggested roadmap for future Internet governance we can guarantee freedom of digital opportunity for generations to come  The U S  Chamber appreciates the consideration of this content and is happy to answer any questions you may have 

The U S  Chamber and the Brazil Council are at your disposal to provide additional information and to contribute to the very important discussion about the future of Internet Governance during your event in April in Brazil 

Yours Truly

The GSMA appreciates the opportunity to submit a contribution to the Global Multistakeholder Meeting on the Future of Internet Governance  to be held in Sao Paolo from   -   April      
As the global trade association for the mobile industry  the GSMA represents the community of mobile network operators  as well as members of the broader mobile ecosystem  including handset makers  software companies  equipment providers  Internet companies  and media and entertainment organisations  that collectively deliver the Internet and will continue to deliver the Internet to the next generation of mobile Internet subscribers  Currently there are      billion mobile connections and     billion individual subscribers covering every country on the planet  Mobile operators alone have invested over $  trillion USD over the last six years in developing and building out mobile internet infrastructure  Clearly this industry underpins and enables the growth of the Internet worldwide (Source  The Mobile Economy Report  GSMA Intelligence  February     ) 
A very significant proportion of total broadband and other Internet connections are made using mobile networks  and that growth – nurtured and stimulated by competition – is accelerating  The growth of mass-market mobile connections to the Internet is important to the world for many reasons  It provides increased access to education  vital medical and governmental services  and unprecedented opportunities for new job creation  Importantly  increased mobile and Internet penetration has demonstrated a positive impact on economic growth  especially in the developing world  While mobile operators provide connectivity to end users and are the first point of contact in the customer relationship  with the advent of the  Internet of Things   mobile networks are also helping to expand the Internet to new territories by facilitating Machine to Machine (M M) communication through SIM-enabled devices and mobile networks 
Internet policy should encourage mobile operators to continue to invest and give them the freedom to provide innovative new networks and services that will drive the continued growth of the Internet  Competition and a light touch regulatory environment have enabled the mobile industry to innovate in access and connectivity through private sector investment and the roll-out of network infrastructure worldwide  For this to continue  the mobile and Internet ecosystems need stable and predictable regulatory regimes  based on a level-playing field for all actors and free from uncertainty at national and international levels  The output of the review must be focused on Internet governance principles and must not introduce global regulations or prescriptive recommendations that risk hampering operators  ability to invest and innovate  On this basis  the GSMA  on behalf of the mobile industry  seeks to contribute to proposals for the stable evolution of the current Internet governance model  These proposals must be carefully analysed and tested and must have consensus from the broad multistakeholder community  including the mobile industry 
Principles for Internet Governance
The mobile industry has a critical role to play in the worldwide availability and adoption of the Internet  Mobile networks will be key to ensure inclusion and to bring the benefits of the Internet to individual subscribers everywhere  The GSMA therefore contributes the following points for consideration to the discussion in Sao Paolo on a set of principles for Internet governance 
   We support the decentralised development of the Internet marked by a governance approach supporting commercial flexibility  choice and competition that foster business model diversity  This is the governance model that is best suited to the dynamic nature of the Internet  Its strength is its ability to adapt rapidly to changing technologies and user requirements  Internet access should remain market-driven and responsive to the needs of the users of the Internet  This will continue to enable the economic growth  prosperity and well-being that we see today 
   The current global nature of the Internet has brought social and economic benefit to users all around the world  and the rapid growth of the Internet has facilitated a wide variety of technological innovation in networks and infrastructure  The governance of the Internet should be underpinned by a coherent set of common principles shared by all stakeholders from different sectors in order to ensure the continuation of a global and seamless Internet that brings benefit to all 
   We support a collaborative  diverse and inclusive model for Internet governance that is open  transparent and multistakeholder  Within the multistakeholder model we believe that all relevant stakeholders – including industry  governments  the technical community  civil society and academia – have an important part to play regarding the Internet s development  We recognise that there are some Internet-related issues  such as privacy and security  where governments have an especially important role to play  In others  however  such as standards development  technical and private sector relationships are paramount  This dynamic among stakeholders allows for a better match between governance issues and governance institutions  Any evolution of the current governance model should include the principles of flexibility and agility and they should be applied so that all relevant stakeholders are represented appropriately 
   We support the ongoing internationalisation of the Internet  and of Internet governance mechanisms  including ICANN and IANA  We urge all parties to continue carefully on the path towards a multistakeholder accountability framework to ensure that changes will enhance the security  stability  resilience and interoperability of the Internet  Any evolution of Internet activities  including naming and numbering  must be resilient  secure  stable and inclusive  The current system relies on these characteristics and they must be maintained and protected 
A framework for the evolution of the Internet governance model
The GSMA contributes the following points for consideration in the discussion in Sao Paolo on a framework for the evolution of the Internet governance model 
   Internet governance models  in their various aspects  must remain multistakeholder and inclusive of all those who wish to participate  Issues should be resolved with due process in a clear and transparent way  The role of mobile network operators must be meaningfully taken into account in any discussions affecting the infrastructure of the Internet  given the crucial role of connectivity functions in the Internet ecosystem 
   Legitimacy and trust in the governance model must be reinforced through an improved inclusiveness and wider geographical representation  particularly vis-à-vis developing country stakeholders 
   An analysis of the work of existing multistakeholder mechanisms should be carried out  noting the similar activity being undertaken under the auspices of the CSTD Working Group on enhanced co-operation (CSTD-WG on EC)  with a view to streamlining processes and eliminating duplication and to determine whether there is a need to change or even create new processes or institutions  Nevertheless  the current multistakeholder fora such as the Internet Governance Forum (IGF)  the IETF and ICANN should be strengthened in order to reflect the changing nature and scope of Internet governance  This framework should be capable of addressing relevant issues for which mechanisms have not yet been identified and/or developed 
   No governance body should be seen as competing with another or duplicating processes  All processes have value in contributing to the global Internet governance debate  The long-term ambition should be to implement a framework that clarifies which governance body has the authority to act on which subject matter  The framework should clarify whether and how the interrelated activities of different governance bodies should be coordinated with one another 
   The IGF has played a very important role in bringing together stakeholders  Its policy outcomes should be integrated into other  existing governance mechanisms  The IGF should be better funded and its role and influence expanded  Interactions between the global IGF and the regional and national IGFs should also be strengthened 
Conclusion
The mobile industry is delivering the mobile Internet at an extraordinarily fast rate to people all over the world  Mobile operators are in a unique position to contribute to the evolution of Internet governance discussions 
The mobile industry believes in an open Internet that is safe  secure  stable and interoperable  Openness is essential for innovation at the core and at the edges of mobile network Internet infrastructure  We must be able to expand our networks and innovate with new technologies and business models in order to deliver the Internet globally as the demand for mobile Internet connectivity continues to grow dramatically 
The GSMA and its members look forward to continuing to work with other stakeholders to contribute to the ongoing preparations for the Sao Paolo meeting and its successful outcome 

Contribution of Telefonica to NETmundial

 

March  th      

 
 

First of all  Telefónica wants to express its support for NETmundial and congratulate the Government of Brazil for this good effort to evolve the existing model of Internet Governance through holding a multistakeholder conference and by inviting a range of influential other governments 

Telefónica  S A  is an active stakeholder in the Internet Governance debate and wants with these comments help to build a solid base for the discussions at NETmundial and to help bridging the divergent views to make the conference a success on the way to a more inclusive and better Internet Governance 

   Internet Governance Principles

The electronic communications industry has made possible the unparalleled expansion of Internet connections and penetration worldwide  A very significant proportion of total broadband and other Internet connections are made using mobile networks  and that growth – nurtured and stimulated by competition – is accelerating  Today  Internet users are mainly from emerging economies and access the Internet via mobile devices  this should also be reflected in the way the Internet is governed  To maintain this pace and give access to those still unconnected  to be able to provide them with education  vital medical and governmental services and open unprecedented opportunities for new job creation and economic growth  it is crucial that Internet policy allows also telecommunications operators to provide innovative services and encourages them to continue to invest in new networks and infrastructure 

Competition and a regulatory and policy framework that attract investments are needed to provide Internet for all and the necessary private investments to roll-out new infrastructures worldwide  Also  long-term broadband and communication investments need stable and predictable regulatory regimes  based on a level-playing field for all actors and free from uncertainty at national and international levels  Today  the level and intensity of regulation differs considerably between various parts of the Internet value chain  Going forward  the sustainability of the Internet will also depend on finding a level-playing field for all actors across the Internet value chain 

We recognize the efforts made during the last years to define a common set of principles for the Internet  There are already many principle documents agreed by various international fora and institutions (OECD  G   European Commission) regarding the Internet NETmundial should built on these but focus on finding principles for the Governance of the Internet (in contrast to  General Internet Principles)  but obviously such principles for the Governance of the Internet need to be aligned with the more general Internet Principles 

 

The outcome would be a global set of Internet Governance Principles  which could serve as a global reference point and a guiding light for all stakeholders about the Governance of the Internet  NETmundial should try to get agreements between all stakeholders on such a key set of governance principles that have made the Internet a global success  Telefonica believes that this will be rather few than many principles and that they need to capture broad consensus between all stakeholders and involved parties 

The Internet has become such a fantastic success because it was based on a governance structure that was open to all interested stakeholders  global in reach and guided by a cooperative spirit between all involved parties  This is a basis which is not found in any other area of international policy and governance and should be respected simply due to the fact that it was the basis of the growth of the Internet up to now and has overall worked considerably well  However  the amazing growth of the Internet is putting stress on this model of Internet Governance  While in      two-thirds of all Internet users were from the developed world  in      two-thirds will stem from emerging economies  This brings all challenges of international Public Policy to the Internet and makes its governance more challenging due to an increased diversity of views  morals and interests  NETmundial should therefore be an important step to evolve the Internet Governance model by building on its existing foundations and without endangering its growth  resilience and stability 

Telefonica believes that finding such global consensus on Internet Governance would be crucial to restore trust and confidence of users and states in the Internet and create a basis for a sustainable growth of the Internet  Such growth is needed to get everyone connected to the Internet based on interconnected Internet infrastructures and networks   

Telefonica therefore believes that NETmundial should considerthe following key principles and outcomes for the Internet and its Governance 

 

( )     Promote an Internet which is economically sustainable  interconnected  secure  stable and resilient and thereby able to build confidence for all its users globally 

 

( )     Protect Human Rights and fundamental principles like the rule of law for Internet users in the same way online as they are protected offline

 

( )     Commit to a collaborative  inclusive and open Internet Governance where no single stakeholder or group of stakeholder dominates but all stakeholders work together and can engage on equal footing and in accordance with their respective roles  this includes also governments in their recognized role as representatives of societies for the definition of Public Policy on national and international level 

 

( )     Acknowledge that the current government mechanisms for technical and operational matters of the Internet have proved to make it a remarkably stable and resilient system and that the technical community and private sector should retain their leading roles for the day-to-day management of a global  interconnected Internet    

 

( )     Ensure that Internet Governance processes are improved and defined to be fully transparent  inclusive and easily accessible  but also accountable for their decisions and flexible enough to adapt to the fast-changing nature of the Internet 

 

   A roadmap for the further evolution of the Internet Governance System

For Telefónica  any roadmap for the evolution of the Internet Governance System should ensure that all affected parties are included in this process on equal footing  in their respective roles and in an open  transparent and accessible way  We congratulate NETmundial and the Brazilian government for their efforts to achieve this in the organization of the conference 

We also recognize that the existing governance mechanisms and organizations dealing with Internet Governance have worked considerably well and allowed the fantastic development of the Internet to a global  interconnected network of networks  This by itself gives these governance mechanism and institutions the legitimacy to be listened to and heard in the current debate  Institutions like the I-Stars (ICANN  IETF  ISOC  etc ) and also platforms like the UN IGF have great merits for the development of the Internet as we know it 

Internet Governance has today developed to be a global governance model sui generis and is much more than any other governance mechanism based on collaboration between stakeholders  Especially private actors and technical entities lead and ensure the day-to-day management of its core functions and do the investments needed in infrastructure and services to create what is referred to as  The Internet    

Telefonica believes that traditional governance models  which are based on top-down decision making processes and multilateral agreements between governments  usually agreed in lengthy negotiations  cannot be the most adequate for governing the fast-changing Internet with its global reach and private  interconnected networks  However  we also acknowledge that due to the increasingly global and diverse user base of the Internet and its key role for the economic developments of all nations and states  Internet Governance processes need to better involve Public Policy concerns from governments and states and need to evolve accordingly 

Telefónica therefore believes that NETmundial should set out the areas where an evolution of Internet Governance is deemed necessary and where there is the most urgent need to evolve the currently existing governance mechanism  Once these areas are defined  a roadmap to address such changes should be agreed 

We believe that this review needs to distinguish carefully between different areas and issues of Internet Governance as not all have the same impact on Public Policy  At the same time  not all issues need the same involvement and same set of stakeholders  institutions and partiesto define solutions  to give an example  setting standards and agree technical protocols for the Internet has worked considerably well under the existing governance mechanisms which are lead by private companies and entities  However  how to protect privacy and security of Internet users on a global level is a much more difficult and controversial issue and has a much higher impact on Public Policy and clearly need to involve governments in a leading role  At the same time the example of Online Privacy also shows that it might also be necessary to distinguish between global and local (or regional) levels  and to use the concept of subsidiarity to decide on what level decisions need to be taken  because many national states protect already privacy online  but there is no global agreement and protection  In general the principle of subsidiarity could be considered to be able to determine which issues need to be solved at global level and which ones can be dealt with by stakeholders at local levels 

Democratically-elected governments are the representatives of the people and therefore are an important source of democratic legitimation regarding Public Policy issues affecting the Internet  They should ensure the existence of open  inclusive and transparent mechanisms for Internet Governance  respect Human Rights and the rule of law  and guarantee the right policy frameworks for competitive digital markets with fair rules for all players(level-playing-field) which are necessary to safeguard increased investments and innovation across all layers of the commercial Internet Ecosystem  They should also engage in relevant processes of Internet Governance and policymaking  especially when and where there is a relevant impact on Public Policy  e g  in issues like online privacy and cyber-security  In such areas solutions without leading involvement of governments  engaging with other stakeholder like the technical community  private sector  civil society and academia  will not be possible to achieve 

The IGF has played a very important role in bringing together stakeholders   As already proposed by the UN working group on improvements of the IGF in       it should be intended to integrate and link its outcomes better to other existing governance mechanisms  The IGF needs to be better funded and interactions between the global IGF and the national and regional IGFs should also be strengthened 

Finally  due to the completely changed nature of today´s Internet  with its global usage and with most users in the emerging world  also the key Internet resources  especially ICANN and the IANA function  need to be globalized  The appropriate process and ways to achieve that goal as soon as possible from a legal and technical point of view and without endangering the stability of the Internet should be defined by NETmundial as well 

The Argentina Internet Association (CABASE)  appreciates this opportunity to participate in this important debate on Internet Governance 

 

We are pleased to submit the following principles as a positive contribution to the discussions in Sao Paulo 

 

 

 

The CABASE ten governing principles on Internet and Net Neutrality

 

   Respect for freedom of individuals and for human rights

 

The use of the Internet must be fostered under principles of freedom of expression  access to information  privacy  free association and other recognized human rights  considering that the Internet is an essential tool for these  and for the construction of a free  just and democratic society 

 

   Diversity

 

The cultural diversity and the plurality of individual beleifs and ideas must be respected and preserved  and their expression must be stimulated through technical innovation  discouraging the imposition of dogmas  customs or particular values in the network 

 

   Democratic and cooperational governance and regulation

 

The governance and regulation of the diverse aspects of the Internet  must be performed in a transparent  multistakeholderl and democratic way  with the participation of the diverse sectors of society  preserving and fostering their collective creation characteristics 

 

   Universality of access and digital inclusion

 

Access to the Internet must be universal  thus becoming a tool for human  social and economic development  and contributing to the construction of an inclusive and non-discriminatory society for the benefit of all  All people should be able to receive the necessary training that enables them to make good use of the Internet  and take advantage of all it s possibilities 

 

   Innovation

 

The continuous development and widespread advertising of the new information services and technologies must be fostered  in order to promote innovation and social and economic development 

 

   The intermediaries are not responsible for the activities of the network users

 

All the measures adopted to counteract ilicit internet user activities  must be directed to the parties directly responsible for these activities  and not to the technological intermediaries who provide Internet services  always respecting the fundamental principles of freedom  privacy  lawfulness  presumption of innocence  due process and the democratic division of the public powers 

 

   The functionality  security and stability of the network

 

The stability of the network  it s security and global functionality must be actively preserved by means of adopting technical measures that are compatible with international standards  and encouraging the adoption of best practices No one should have the ability to  turn off  the Internet totally or partially  in a territory and/or a specific segment of the population  and the service providers must be able to provide their services freely 

 

   Interconnection

 

The interconnection between various Internet actors  within non-discriminatory conditions that enable guaranteed access to the network and it s contents in all the national territory  must be promoted 

 

   Interoperability

 

The arquitecture of the Internet and the communications systems  must be based on open standards that enable interoperability 

 

    Juridical and standard-based environments

 

The juridical and regulatory environments must preserve the dynamics of the Internet  as an open collaborative space for all users  and must be guaranteed to remain free of blocks  interruptions  censures  interferences and surveillance 

Google Contribution
to the Global Multistakeholder Meeting on the Future of Internet Governance
Introduction
Google welcomes the opportunity to submit a contribution to the Global Multistakeholder
Meeting on the Future of Internet Governance (NETmundial)  Our company s mission is
to organize the world s information and make it universally accessible and useful  and
without a secure  stable  interoperable  resilient  and open Internet  there would be no
Google 
The Internet s effects on economic growth  commerce  innovation and creativity are
unprecedented  According to the McKinsey Global Institute  the Internet accounts for   
percent of GDP growth in the last five years in developed countries  as well as in   
surveyed developing countries  [ ]
However  despite the significant positive impact of the Internet  its further development
stands at a crossroads  The entire Internet community including
governments 
businesses  civil society  academic and technical experts  and individual users must
continue working together if we want the Internet to remain an open  vibrant platform for
innovation  growth  and the free exchange of ideas  and if we want to expand the reach
of this technology to those who remain unconnected 
Section    Internet Governance Principles
We believe that preserving and advancing open and consultative decisionmaking
is
essential to
ensuring that global citizens are able to take advantage of this transformative platform
both now
and in the future  As such  we support the following principles 
? Policies should ensure a safe  secure  open  interoperable  and resilient Internet 
? Policies should support opening and maintaining international markets in a way
that allows for the seamless flow of digital services  applications  products  and
information  particularly across national borders 
? Policies should foster innovation 
? Policies should support capacity building and implementation of best practices in
relation to network security 
? Policies should recognize that individual human rights apply online just as they do
offline 
? Policies should promote expanding access to the Internet so that it reaches all
citizens across the globe 
 
A governance structure that honors the substantive principles above should also include
certain procedural characteristics 
? Governance structures should be open  transparent  and accountable to all
stakeholders  All members of the Internet community whether
individual users 
governments  civil society  businesses  and members of the academic and
technical community have
an interest in preserving the Internet as a critical
platform for communication and information exchange  and therefore all
stakeholders should be included in governance discussions  Moreover  all of
these stakeholders have contributed to the development of the Internet to date 
and working together  they have driven unprecedented growth in access to  uses
of  and innovation on the Internet  They must continue to be involved in any future
model of Internet governance 
At Google  we see these principles as a natural extension of our company s philosophy 
in which we recognize the need to focus on Internet users first  the need for information
that crosses all borders  and the power of the web to empower global citizens 
We believe that there is broad agreement on the high level principles we have
articulated here  and we support additional work on and discussion of universal
principles  The work on establishing Internet principles should continue as an ongoing
process  and NETmundial should not measure its success or failure by agreement or
lack thereof on
a new  universal set of principles  Indeed  there may never be a
 constitutional moment  for the Internet  but our goal should be ensuring alignment on
principles by all stakeholders  [ ]
Section    Roadmap for the Further Evolution of the Internet Governance
Ecosystem
The Current System
Because Internet governance is multifaceted spanning
technical  political  and policy
issues there
is no single organization that manages or has jurisdiction over all Internet
policy questions  instead  the Internet s policies and protocols have rapidly evolved
through a set of diverse organizations  Together  a robust set of multistakeholder
Internet institutions  each with different core functions and strengths  address nearly all
Internet policy and technical issues 
A few such examples include 
? The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF)  which develops global standards
and protocols 
? The Internet Corporation for Assigned of Names and Numbers (ICANN)  which
manages the global system for Internet naming  numbering  and addressing 
? The Internet Governance Forum (IGF)  which brings together academia 
governments  civil society  and industry as a means of fostering the discussion of
critical Internet issues  and
? The Internet Society (ISOC)  a technical organization  which seeks to promote the
open development  evolution  and use of the Internet for the benefit of all people
throughout the world 
 
While these organizations each address a significant number of issues  the Internet
governance framework s inherent flexibility also enables issuespecific
organizations to
play useful roles in addressing critical questions  A few of these specialized groups
include 
? The Messaging  Malware and Mobile AntiAbuse
Working Group and Stop
Badware  both global memberdriven
organization that works collaboratively to
address various forms of messaging abuse (such as spam  viruses 
denialofservice
attacks and other messaging exploitations) through industry
collaboration  technology  and public policy initiatives 
? The Forum for Incident Response and Security Teams (FIRST)  which brings
together a variety of computer security incident response teams from
government  commercial  and educational organizations and aims to foster
cooperation and coordination in incident prevention and incident response and to
promote information sharing among members and the community atlarge 
? Global Computer Incident Response Teams (CIRTs)  multistakeholder
organizations responsible for leading efforts to improve cybersecurity online 
coordinate cyber information sharing  and proactively manage cyber risks  and
? The Alliance for Affordable Internet  which brings together governments  civil
society  and the private sector to promote policy changes that enable affordable
Internet access 
Today  we face two significant challenges  First  we must make the organizations that
address Internet governance questions whether
they are technical or policyoriented
more
inclusive and transparent while at the same time ensuring their continued
effectiveness in solving new challenges in an ever changing world  Second  we must
tackle the challenge of connecting the rest of the globe to the Internet 
Increasing Inclusivity  Transparency  and Accountability in Existing
Organizations
Google has pursued a number of initiatives to improve existing Internet governance
organizations  Below we include just a few examples of such work 
? Internet Governance Forum  Google believes that the UNchartered
Internet
Governance Forum (IGF) is the premier forum for robust and inclusive debate of
key Internet governance and global Internet policy issues  It is the only forum that
brings together all stakeholders to discuss these issues  However  the IGF is at a
critical stage  it is in desperate need of consistent funding in order to continue
operating  and it could be strengthened by further improving transparency
regarding its operations and broadening its efforts to reach new stakeholders 
We support efforts to ensure the IGF s sustainability and to improve its inclusivity 
transparency  and accountability 
? Facilitating discussions between policymakers and the technical community 
Google supports meetings of regional operators groups (e g   AfNOG  MENOG) 
regional Internet registries (e g   AfriNIC) and regional peering and
interconnection fora (AfPIF)  We have also worked with the Internet Engineering
Task Force (IETF) to make it easier for regulators from across the globe to
 
participate in IETF meetings and better understand the bottom up 
multistakeholder
process of Internet standards development 
Expanding Internet Access
Google is committed to working with all stakeholders on the technology  policy  and
business solutions for improving Internet access  We have made significant investments
in a number of areas 
? Innovative solutions for increasing broadband access and decreasing its cost 
There is no single technology or platform that will achieve global connectivity  and
we are working on several different projects  Project Loon  our earlystage
effort
to deliver broadband via highaltitude
balloons  is one of many exploratory
initiatives aimed at connecting remote and hardtoreach
localities  We have also
invested in Project Link  a fiber network in Kampala  Uganda  that aims to improve
Internet access by connecting existing  local networks to the undersea cables
that  in turn  connect the Internet between continents  Similarly  Google has long
advocated that unused channels in the television broadcast spectrum called
 white spaces  be
used to deliver lowcost
broadband in unserved and
underserved areas  To that end  we have developed a database to make this
spectrum available for the transmission of broadband 
? The African School on Internet Governance  Last July  Google sponsored the first
African School on Internet Governance in Durban  South Africa  The School
brought together government officials  technical experts  academics and business
leaders  and highlighted the inherent power of the multistakeholder
model by
incorporating all these views in the development of strategies for using the
Internet as a platform for economic  social  political  and cultural development 
? Driving demand for locally relevant content  Online content drives Internet
adoption  To that end  we have worked with local businesses across the globe to
help them establish an online presence  Not only does this effort contribute to
locally relevant content  it allows small businesses to grow their revenues by
expanding to a broader  potentially global  audience  We have also made
significant achievements in localizing Google content for national audiences  for
example  in Africa alone  we have developed localized country domains for over
   countries and provide content in    languages  In addition  we have
expended considerable efforts to put the world s cultural treasures online with
such initiatives as the Google Cultural Institute  which has put the collections of
over     leading museums online to date 
We offer these illustrative examples as ways that we are tackling two critical challenges
facing the Internet community  Of course  it will take more work in the coming months
and years from a variety of stakeholders to order to meet these challenges 
The Path Forward
There has never been a single road  no single  one stop shop  for Internet governance 
instead  there are are multiple organizations and actors that all contribute to Internet
governance development  The Internet s rules have rapidly evolved in diverse
 
organizations like the IETF  which cooperates on the development of open standards  or
ICANN  which manages naming and addressing  Of course  governments are heavily
involved in regulating the Internet through regulations addressing privacy  fair use  libel 
competition  and other matters  The technology community is spread across many
sectors and its work creates implicit and sometimes explicit bounds on behavior  And
many individuals and civil society organizations engage to provide independent
perspectives on behalf of users  These are just a few examples  and amazingly  all these
groups collaborate with each other to set collective rules for the advancement of the
Internet ecosystem 
In sum  the Internet governance ecosystem is complex in a way that reflects the social 
political  and business contentions of the world in which we live  One of the early heads
of the Internet Architecture Board (IAB)  David Clark (with others) summarized some of
the governance challenges by observing that  as the Internet becomes mainstream it
inevitably moves from being an engineering curiosity to being a mirror of the societies in
which it operates   This is even more true today 
The Internet community does not lack for places to discuss key Internet policy and
governance questions  Rather  a critical concern voiced by some stakeholders is that
the rubric of organizations and overlapping missions is confusing and difficult to navigate
without considerable time and effort  While these concerns are valid  they do not
necessarily counsel in favor of directing all Internet policy discussions into one body 
Rather  we must find a way to take advantage of the richness of the ecosystem while
making it easier to navigate  especially for new entrants 
As such  as Internet policy discussions continue to evolve  we believe stakeholders
should continue to rely on the existing structures to develop global policies that benefit
all users rather than relying on either the creation of another governance body or on
multilateral approaches  To make the processes easier to navigate  we believe that one
way to approach to the development of a  roadmap  requires us look at the map through
the lens of the Internet s technical architecture  In particular  the Internet s  layered
model  provides a way to understand the ecosystem  The technical layer deals with the
Internet s infrastructure  standards  routing protocols  On top of the technical layer are
the content and social layers  within which the applications and services of the Internet
are found  Although there are different ways to think about the layered system  we
believe the conceptualization of the Internet in these layers helps provide a basis for a
discussion about which institutions and stakeholder groups should be involved in which
Internet policy issues  and within which  layers  they operate  [ ]
The whole Internet ecosystem is likely to benefit from mapping the existing Internet
governance institutions and clarifying their roles as stewards for particular Internet
governance practices and policymaking 
Doing so can also help identify the areas or
issues that are not yet addressed within the ecosystem and help identify areas that
require further attention 
 
Conclusion
We look forward to the opportunity to discuss these proposals and others with
representatives from governments  the private sector  civil society  and the technical
community in Sao Paulo  And  we look forward to working together with all stakeholders
in moving toward a shared goal  continued  robust growth of an open Internet that
enables economic development  cultural advancement  and the free exchange of ideas
and information to every nation and person on the globe

ETNO fully supports the move towards a universal set of principles on Internet governance and for the NetMundial conference to address such an initiative  The process to conclude such a framework will undoubtedly be complex  as such principles may reflect values and values across different cultures tend to vary  however we see the process of developing a global set of principles as being an important step towards understanding the various stakeholderneeds and issues that we see emerging today  Although many argue that there can be no one global framework for the Internet nor one defined set of rules/norms  it is also the case that this lack of a normative reference architecture also significantly weakens any arguments against certain behaviours and can frustrate any debate around how to move forward with improvements  As constituents in different parts of the world grapple with current policy issues  different answers may emerge depending on different reference frameworks  One of the goals of the Brazil meeting should be recognition that these principles should be shared and considered as common principles by all stakeholders of the meeting 

 

ETNO believes that NetMundial should build on work that has been carried out by organisations such as the OECD and the European Commissionbut that the primary focus in Brazil should be on establishing Principles for the Governance of the Internet as opposed to General Internet Principles  This is an important difference that we wish to underline  Moreover   few rather than many  principles should be the guideline  if NetMundial wishes to see success and acknowledging the complexity of the task that we have before us   Global consensus on Internet Governance principles will be critically important for the restoration of trust and confidence of Internet users and to allow for the continued growth of the Internet 

 

Against this background  ETNO suggests the following as guiding Internet governance principles 

    The global Internet governance modelshould involve all necessary stakeholders on an equal footing and in accordance with their respective roles  Reflecting the societal importance of the Internet  it is recognised that Governments have a role  as representatives of society  in the elaboration of Internet public policy 
    Internet Governance processes should be transparent  inclusive and accessible and all actors must be held accountable for their decisions 
    The Internet should be economically sustainable  interconnected  safe  resilient and secure 
    Respect for human rights and fundamental principles  such as privacy and security  are of paramount importance and the same rule of law should apply online as it does offline 

 

 

 

Further Evolution of the Internet Governance Model  Roadmap

 

ETNO believes that the roles and responsibilities of each participating Internet governance organisation and process should be made clear and  to the greatest extent possible  not be over-lapping  No one governance body should be seen as competing with another and all parts can be equal in contributing to the global Internet governance debate  We should have the ambition to have a system that clarifies which organisation has the authority to act on which subject matter  or which organisations collaborate with each other  and we believe this to be an important step in the roadmapping process  We also draw attention to the the European Commission s plans to launch the Global Internet Policy Observatory (GIPO)  which will serve as a valuable resource on Internet policy/regulation  actors and and technology  and better enable emerging economies in particular to engage on Internet governance and policy matters 

 

Democratically-elected governments are the representatives of the people and therefore their role in the development of public policy must be recognised  When it comes to high impact public policy issues such as the protection of privacy and the security of Internet users  Governments arguably have a leading role to play in navigating the debate with their citizens  However  in other areas such as standards setting and the development of technical protocols  the private sector should continue to take the lead  The checks and balances for such a governance model should come from a multi-stakeholder accountability mechanism for all actors involved in any decision making process 

 

Whilst the US Government s oversight of the IANA functions has been a suitable model to date  ETNO believes that the ever increasing globalization of the Internet needs to be reflected in appropriate governance mechanism and institutions  A central part of that debate between all relevant stakeholders needs to be the question around whether the IANA functions should continue to be subject to an US Government procurement contract  ETNO very much welcomed the Montevideo Statement on the Future of Internet Cooperation which calls for  accelerating the globalization of ICANN and IANA functions  towards an environment in which all stakeholders  including all governments  participate on an equal footing   As such  we believe this to be an important topic for discussion in Brazil  Notwithstanding the need to consider a new model  ETNO also recognises the importance of continuing to ensure the stability and security of the Internet and the need for any alternative options to guarantee same 

 

Finally  and as business representatives  our primary interest is be to ensure that no new barriers to the growth of the Internet as a global platform for economic and social development are introduced as a result of the NetMundial discussions  Any outcomes of the Brazil meeting should seek to foster the continued development of the Internet and recognise its dynamic nature 

Set of Internet governance Principles

We welcome the discussion on the development of a coherent set of international principles for the Internet  Such work should  where possible  use existing international principles and agreements  and not seek to apply a special framework for the Internet that could not be justified in the physical world 

Similarly  we should not seek to establish international Internet governance principles for issues where there is already an accepted framework for such discussions 

Any framework of principles should be at a sufficiently high level and should be appropriate for international applicability  we should not try to solve national or regional issues through an international framework   A framework of principles needs to reflect true global consensus 

In particular  principles should not include what would more appropriately be addressed by guidelines  which are operational decisions  or which are too detailed or specific   this could constrain innovation and the framework would quickly become outdated 

This may lead to a limited number of agreed principles   However  if they are genuinely agreed  accepted and adopted  this will provide a better framework to guide the development of the Internet  and of Internet governance  than a longer or more detailed list that is mainly ignored 

 

Roadmap for the Further Evolution of the Internet Governance Ecosystem

We endorse the importance of multi-stakeholder engagement  which received global recognition through the WSIS process and which continues to provide a successful framework for the development and growth of the Internet   Since Tunis there has been considerable progress to improve and broaden engagement  and the model has underpinned the rapid uptake of the Internet and the work done in tackling barriers to Internet access 

We recognise that further work needs to be done to continue to improve engagement   The multi-stakeholder model continues to evolve in response to the changing Internet environment   The many organisations responsible for essential tasks associated with the Internet have developed engagement strategies appropriate to their needs  ensuring the greatest benefit from the partnership and cooperation relevant to their specific circumstances   We believe that the multi-stakeholder model will continue to develop and adapt to the changing Internet environment  but would caution against identifying a single model as the  correct  approach for all situations or all organisations   one size does not fit all 

The Internet Governance Forum  perhaps the most successful output from the WSIS process  continues to play a vital role in improving understanding of issues associated with the Internet   Those who have engaged actively in the IGF benefit from their involvement through the wealth of knowledge and support that their involvement unlocks   sharing information about good practice and solutions that have worked is an effective way of capacity building 

Again  we recognise the need for the IGF to continue to develop to respond to real interests and needs   we believe that the IGF has shown remarkable ability to evolve over the relatively short period it has been in existence   This has been driven by the participants themselves and we welcome an approach that focuses on user needs and interests to shape the development of the IGF model 

We recognise the need for a roadmap for the further evolution of the Internet governance ecosystem and  in particular to maintain and develop global engagement and accountability   In particular  we welcome the reaffirmation in the I* Montevideo Communiqué  to accelerate the globalisation of ICANN and IANA functions towards an environment in which all stakeholders participate on an equal footing 

As noted above  the multi-stakeholder model to addressing the management of key Internet functions has shown itself as successful  resilient and open to evolution and  since the WSIS Tunis Agenda  it has developed significantly   However  we also recognise the importance of ensuring clear accountability between the organisations responsible for the essential tasks associated with the Internet and the communities that they serve   This is a vital step in the development of improved globalisation 

In particular  we would note ICANN s Affirmation of Commitment with the US government   the introduction of a regular review process was a major step towards increasing internationalisation of the organisation by making ICANN directly accountable to all its stakeholders 

The US Government currently does appear to have the final say  should ICANN not maintain reasonable processes of accountability and responsibility   A clear process to ensure that ICANN does meet its obligations is needed   we would be concerned if there were ambiguity about the legal jurisdiction for the company  given the policy  operational and contractual functions that it exercises 

We would welcome wider engagement in the AoC processes as an important step in developing this clear accountability 

We would also note the importance of improving stakeholder engagement between communities in ICANN   In particular  the role of the Governmental Advisory Committee and the way it works with other parts of ICANN needs to be addressed by the GAC in discussion with the wider community of stakeholders in ICANN 

The IANA function  carried out under contract to the US Government  is of particular importance to Nominet as a country-code top-level domain registry and  in the future  as a geographic community gTLD registry   Our interest is in that part which looks after the management of changes to the root-zone file   This is essentially an administrative and technical function  based on policy developed elsewhere (in ICANN  the IETF or ISO)   However  it is a vital function and needs to be managed very carefully 

We were pleased to see the development of the current contractual arguments for the IANA   In particular we welcome the increased transparency of the process and the emphasis on the management of the IANA as a service introduced in the recent contract between ICANN and the US Government   We also welcome the increased automation in the operation of the process  which allows the registry maximum autonomy in the management of its TLD   This opens the way to a direct relationship with the national organisation  without the involvement of other parties 

While current responsibility for the IANA is with the US Government  we would note the underlying commitment to the Tunis Agenda  and in particular to paragraph    that says that   countries should not be involved in decisions regarding another country s country-code Top-Level Domain    We would interpret this as meaning that only the country served by a ccTLD should be involved   (In most cases governments do not feel any need to be involved individually or collectively in the operation of their ccTLD   However  ccTLDs  along with many of the new geographically-focussed gTLDs  have the primary duty of serving their local community )

The circumstances associate with the IANA in relationship with ccTLDs does not lend itself to simple solutions – again  one single model does not fit all   There is ongoing work in ICANN on clarifying the policy basis for delegation and revocation of a ccTLD and this might provide a basic framework for administrative and technical decisions   This should make it easier to allow the manager of the IANA to be globally accountable for its stewardship and directly accountable to the registry and country in the case of a ccTLD 

In summary  we believe that a roadmap should 

·         Identify and develop consensus on the direction of travel and objectives for the community for each of the organisations in the Internet governance ecosystem   This should include inter-governmental organisations like the ITU  as well as international organisations like ICANN and the RIRs   Multi-stakeholder engagement needs to be seen as the main process for developing and maintaining accountability  relevance and appropriate decision making 

·         For the IGF  the processes of accountability and for developing the model are already in place and generally effective   Attention needs to be given to increasing engagement in the IGF and encouraging the development of national and regional structures to support this   Improving the funding model also needs to be a major priority 

·         For ICANN  the basis processes for assuring wider accountability and transparency have been put in place in the Affirmation of Commitments   Widening ownership of  and engagement in  this process is important   Similarly  ensuring better processes for reaching consensus (while recognising the specific interests  responsibilities and accountability of different stakeholders) will be needed as we move forward  especially given the massive increase in the number of contracted parties in ICANN and the continued growth in the number of other stakeholders who are becoming more interested and active in shaping the discussions 

·         For the management of the IANA  developing improved globalisation in the management of the root-zone file is not a trivial objective  given the different relationships that exist   The ccTLD community needs to be closely involved in this process to ensure national as well as global accountability   A first step needs to be to reach consensus on the policy framework for the delegation and revocation of ccTLDs  work currently underway in ICANN s ccTLD community in close cooperation with the GAC

Submission by AHCIET to the Global Multistakeholder Meeting on the Future of Internet Governance  NETMundial
AREA  Internet Governance principles and roadmap for the further evolution of the Internet Governance ecosystem 
Entitled by  Pablo Bello
Region  Latin-America
Organization  AHCIET
Sector  Telecommunications
Keywords  Integrity  robustness and resiliency of the network  human rights  globalization  security 
AHCIET wants to express its support for NETMundial and congratulate the Government of Brazil for this big effort to evolve the existing model of Internet Governance and appreciates the opportunity to submit a contribution to this relevant meeting 
Latin American telecom operators are working hard developing and delivering Internet thorough the region and they want to enhance the cooperation with the other stakeholders contributing to the discussions towards the evolution of Internet Governance model 
We want to recognize the current channels of discussion established in the context of Internet Governance to date  the consolidated Internet Governance Forum (IGF) with their regional and national branches and the recently created Global Commission on Internet Governance (GCIG) 
AHCIET (Latin American Association of Research Centers and Telecommunication Enterprises) is a non-profit  private organization founded in       It represents the business interests of    Information and Communications Technologies companies from all over Latin America  The Association s mission is to serve as a platform that facilitates dialogue between the public and private sector e g   (international organizations  regulators and governmental authorities )  in order to foster alliances and initiatives resulting in the development of policies  programs and projects that leverage economic and social development of regional economies
Internet Governance Principles 
AHCIET proposes the following items for consideration to the discussion regarding Principles for Internet Governance 
   Respect and protect the Universal Human Rights and the fundamental principle that the people has the same rights online and offline 
o Internet governance arrangements must ensure the protection of all fundamental human rights and freedoms and affirm their universality  indivisibility  interdependence and interrelation in accordance with International Human Rights Law 
   We support an evolved global  collaborative  diverse and inclusive Internet governance model  building on existing foundations and with the involvement of all relevant stakeholders (including industry  governments  the technical community  civil society and academia) on an equal footing and in an open  transparent  efficient and collaborative manner  This model should respect the changing nature of the Internet 
o The current global nature of the Internet has brought social and economic benefit to users all around the world 
o Any proposed changes to the current governance model  have to take into account that the principles of flexibility and agility should be applied and that all relevant stakeholders are represented appropriately 
o The strength of the current model is based in the Internet technical infrastructure  provided from different entities working in a collaborative way  and its ability to adapt the standards and protocols to changing technologies and user requirements  In the evolution of the governance model is necessary to maintain that key principle 
o The Internet governance system must avoid the  primus inter pares  relations  especially when countries are involved 
   The current Internet model has proved to be a useful and effective tool for diffusion and interchange of knowledge  being an obvious incentive to the development of the global economy  Any proposed technical or operational change affecting the core Internet activities  including naming and numbering  has to preserve the integrity of the network as well as its robustness  resiliency  security and stability  In the other side  any proposal to localize the Internet and its governance will affect the operational and economics of the current Internet  and could act as a barrier to the growth itself and undermining socio-economic benefits 
   We recognize that the current government mechanisms for technical and operational matters of the Internet have proved to make it a remarkably stable and resilient system and that the technical community and private sector should retain their leading roles for the day-to-day management of the global  interconnected Internet 
   Issues should be resolved with due process in a clear and transparent way
   AHCIET support the process of globalization of ICANN and IANA functions and we believe that this task must be accelerated with a clear roadmap 
Roadmap for the Further Evolution of the Internet Governance Ecosystem 
Due to the growing diversity of the Internet and its huge social and economic impact  its governance has become more challenging and an issue of international politics 
AHCIET proposes the following for consideration to the discussion regarding Roadmap for the Further Evolution of the Internet Governance Ecosystem 
   Ahciet is aware that the existing mechanisms and organizations dealing with Internet Governance have worked in a good manner allowing the tremendous development
achieved by the Internet  so we are of the opinion that there is no need to create new institutions or a global governing body for the Internet 
   The current multistakeholder fora such as the Internet Governance Forum (IGF)  the IETF and ICANN should be strengthened in order to reflect the changing nature and various aspects of Internet governance  AHCIET believes that the multistakeholder model is the best way to govern the Internet but that it needs to evolve and be improved  An analysis of the work of existing multistakeholder fora should be carried out with a view to streamlining processes identifying overlapping areas where they exist and eliminating duplication 
   The current status of ICANN/IANA should be changed gradually  the initiated globalization process is a good way to go forward in this sense it has to be strengthened and accelerated with a clear roadmap  Therefore  in line with the recent Montevideo Statement on the Future of Internet Cooperation   we are in favor of this process leading to an environment in which all stakeholders  including all Governments  participate on equal footing 
   All stakeholders  including governments  should work together in transparent processes to make sure that everyone can use the Internet with confidence that his or her security and privacy is respected  in this sense  the Internet Governance Forum has played a very important role  have been successful and become more diverse and international It could be better funded and its role and influence expanded 
   AHCIET is the opinion that the roadmap should work clarifying the legitimate involvement of Governments in Internet governance debates  we could support a model whereby Governments are involved  as an equal player  in high-impact Internet public policy issues such as  cybersecurity  critical infrastructure debates and societal/development debates  in this sense the IGF could be the appropriate framework 
o We recognize that there are some Internet-related issues  such as privacy and security  where governments have an especially important role to play 
o The role of the Governmental Advisory Group (GAC) at the ICANN could be strength and clarified 
   The roadmap should also seek to clarify the roles of civil society and business (telecomm operators) 
o Civil society involvement is warranted in areas touching upon civil rights and consumer issues
o Telecom operators should be involved in any discussions affecting their core infrastructure

We applaud the efforts of the Brazilian government to coordinate the engagement of a broad group of stakeholders to discuss such an important topic  Our members operate and invest in every corner of the globe  leveraging the Internet to provide valuable benefits to all types of end users  

 

The Internet represents one of the greatest engines for growth  providing benefits across regions and levels of development  It is the great equalizer  providing businesses of all sizes the opportunity to access the billions of consumers outside of their physical location and to compete on the quality of products offered  The Internet allows consumers  educators  and health providers alike the ability to access the best products and technology and to share information throughout the world 

 

This all depends on a governance structure that is open  transparent  and representative of al stakeholders  The current multistakeholder model approach to Internet governance has fulfilled these needs while creating a decentralized structure that fueled rapid development around the world 

 

In order to ensure that global growth and prosperity continue  we respectfully offer the following principles to serve as a core for Internet governance 

 

* Policies must maintain a bottom-up approach that allows for robust and meaningful input from all stakeholders 

* Policies must be future proof and technology neutral  able to accomodate rapidly developing technology and different types of uses and sectors 

* Policies need to promote a voluntary  industry-led  global system of standard setting 

* Policies should facilitate the stability  security  interoperability  and functionality of the underlying network structure 

* Policies must support the seamless flow of digital services  appliations  products  and information 

 

The roadmap for the future of Internet governance must incorporate the above policy concerns while also maintaining the flexiblity to adapt  One of the great strengths of the inclusive governance model is the ability to nimbly and quickly address fast moving technological changes  The future of Internet governance must avoid codifying rigid rules or moving towards a top-down system  which only causes bottlenecking for decisions and makes it more difficult for a wide-spectrum of stakeholders to participate freely 

 

By ensuring the above principles and following the suggested roadmap for future Internet governance we can guarantee freedom of digital opportunity for generations to come  The Chamber appreciates the consideration of this content and is happy to answer any questions  We are at your disposal to provide additional information and look forward to contributing to the very important discussion in April 

EuroISPA  the European Association of Internet Services Providers (ISPs)  welcomes the opportunity to provide comments to the  Global Multistakeholder Meeting on the Future of Internet Governance   EuroISPA is the world s largest association of ISPs representing the interests of more than      companies across the EU and the EFTA countries  

 

 

 

Our member companies are actively engaged to ensure an open  stable  secure  resilient  and interoperable Internet   We believe that a healthy  vibrant  stable  effective  and pluralistic Internet governance system is essential  and that all stakeholders with a role in developing  maintaining  or using the Internet must be able to participate in  and impact on decisions that would affect them or the Internet  For this reason EuroISPA is actively involved in governance discussions taking place in constituencies such as ICANN  IGF  EuroDIG  Council of Europe  ITU and OECD 

 

 

 

EuroISPA considers that the global structure of the Internet must be preserved  Any approach which aims to find an agreement harmonising Internet laws around the world or concluding a binding international treaty risks dividing  rather than uniting  States given the impact Internet produces on the social  economic  cultural and legal dimensions in each country  We believe that NETmundial has the potential to strengthen national and global governance around a set of high level principles respectful of the rule of law and fundamental freedoms 

 

 

 

EuroISPA considers that NETmundial is not an end in itself but only a starting point towards a long term dialogue on what Internet Governance is 

 

 

 

As a consequence  EuroISPA would like discussions at the NETmundial to focus on the following key points 

 

§  Common understanding of Internet Governance  Internet Governance as a subject should be narrowly defined  A clear distinction needs to be established between the core governance issues and the wider set of areas containing an Internet dimension  The network and data that it carries are in fact entirely separate at the level of policy (and are to be treated as such)

 

§  Existing governance arrangements should be improved and not replaced

 

§  Technology can assist in implementing solutions  but regulating technology per se is not the solution to social or political challenges

Governance Principles as input into the Global Multistakeholder Meeting on the Future of
Internet Governance  to be held    -    April      in Sao Paulo  Brazil  Business focuses in

Members of the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) and its initiative Business Action to
Support the Information Society (BASIS) are pleased to contribute these Global Internet Governance
Principles as input into the Global Multistakeholder Meeting on the Future of Internet Governance  to
be held    -    April      in Sao Paulo  Brazil 
The multistakeholder model approach to Internet governance has created decentralized structures
that govern the Internet  which in turn has fostered unprecedented economic  social  and political
development  The Internet has enabled individuals to access information and services  to connect
and to communicate  and to share ideas and knowledge globally  It has become a powerful engine
for technological innovation  economic growth and the preservation and promotion of cultural
diversity 
Members of ICC BASIS depend on a thriving Internet to do business in a variety of industry sectors
and markets  throughout the world  In particular  we rely upon on a safe  secure  open  interoperable 
and sustainable Internet in order to stay connected with customers  business associates and end
users  And we believe that the multistakeholder model  as continually strengthened and evolved  will
serve our shared interest in a stable and sustainable Internet  Indeed  it is precisely because of this multistakeholder governance model that the Internet has grown into the platform for economic growth
that it is today 
As we look toward the future  we see the following principles as vital to the success of any future
model of Internet governance 
Functionality  security  stability and resiliency of the network  Policies must ensure a safe 
secure  open  interoperable  resilient  seamless and sustainable Internet 
Cross-border flow of data and information  Business stresses the need and importance of crossborder
data flows to the functioning of the digital economy and continued achievement of the
Information Society  While we recognize the need to comply with local laws  including those on
privacy and security  they should be consistent with established trade rules 
Improving and expanding access to the Internet  Policies should stimulate sustainable investment
and deployment of Internet networks and industries  and services that create demand for those
networks  In particular  policies and regulatory frameworks should support innovation  investment 
and competition  including the protection of intellectual property  Standards should be designed to
facilitate interoperability  Efforts to foster local content  improve cultural and linguistic diversity  and
bring access to all global citizens  particularly to those in developing countries  should be supported 
Rule of law  Policies should support the rule of law  which governments have primary responsibility
for advancing 
Application of rights  Offline rights should apply online  especially with respect to freedom of
expression and human rights 
Making decisions in open consultation with all stakeholders  Any discussion about Internet
governance principles  frameworks or processes  should be conducted in a multistakeholder
format  All stakeholders should be appropriately represented in a transparent and accountable
decision-making process 
Business Action to Support the Information Society (BASIS)

Roadmap for the Further Evolution of the

Members of the International Chamber of Commerce s (ICC) initiative Business Action to

Members of the International Chamber of Commerce s (ICC) Business Action to Support the
Information Society (BASIS) initiative are pleased to contribute these considerations for a roadmap
for the further evolution of the Internet governance ecosystem as input into the Global
Multistakeholder Meeting on the Future of Internet Governance  to be held    -    April      in Sao
Paolo  Brazil 
Business welcomes the opportunity to underscore the strength of existing mechanisms and
the multi-stakeholder processes of Internet governance
In view of the increased relevance of the Internet to our society and economy  business supports the
opportunity to examine the existing mechanisms of Internet governance  so that the stakeholder
groups can identify areas of improvement of these mechanisms 
The strength of the current distributed  bottom-up Internet governance process is not only in its open
and inclusive participation model  and the legitimacy and credibility that model fosters  but also its
flexibility to rapidly adapt to changing technologies and issues  For example  local and regional IGF
processes are an effective way to expand participation in Internet governance debate and create a
healthy exchange of ideas at the grassroots level  while also feeding into the global IGF  The
NetMundial meeting in Brazil can contribute to the positive elements of enhanced cooperation and
appropriate  meaningful multistakeholder participation and inclusion through both the principles and
the road map 
The existing multi-stakeholder environment is rich with opportunities to address governance
issues and to vet the perceived need for further mechanisms or processes
Business favours using existing organizations  institutions and processes for any Internet governance
framework discussion Some governments have highlighted a concern about certain Internet-related policy or technical
issues for which they cannot identify relevant existing mechanisms to address their perceived
problems  We feel it is important to note that business  in contributing to the CSTD Working Group
on Enhanced Cooperation s (WGEC) current mapping exercise  identified more than    international
venues  organizations  and private sector  technical community  and civil society initiatives that have
been established to address a broad range of Internet public policy and technical issues 
The upcoming launch of the European Commission s Global Internet Policy Observatory (GIPO) will
provide another valuable online resource on Internet policy  regulations and technology  and better
enable emerging economies in particular to engage on Internet governance and policy matters 
The Global Multistakeholder Meeting on the Future of Internet Governance serves as an opportunity
to review and build on existing work and develop a good process for  ( ) identifying issues that do not
appear to addressed yet  ( ) exchanging information on solution mechanisms already available to
address these issues  or ( ) considering whether new mechanisms need to be developed 
There is a risk that establishing new mechanisms or models  without a thorough and methodical
assessment could drain resources and result in reduced participation by all stakeholders in existing
efforts  Business seeks to avoid the development of new mechanisms that duplicate existing efforts
and supports efforts to strengthen and expand existing mechanisms to address outstanding issues 
to ensure that the Internet remains a vibrant platform for economic growth and innovation 
The evolution and improvement of Governance Mechanisms
The evolution of Internet governance principles  frameworks and accountability mechanisms is a
process that must proceed through careful work and analysis  It is important to better understand the
various alternative options for further progress  It is important to ensure that any changes would
contribute to enhancing the security  stability  privacy  resiliency  and interoperability of the global
Internet  while also ensuring the rule of law and economical and societal benefits 
Business is interested in pursuing a credible and productive discussion and examination of possible
improvements to existing governance mechanisms  including issues related to globalization  There
are many concerns that have been raised related to the need for greater globalization of Internet
Governance mechanisms  Despite the many years where people have been discussing this issue
the topic still means different things to different people  Among the issues  the need for greater
geographic diversity  which might mean a need for greater inclusion  participation  transparency or
oversight  applicable law and jurisdiction  contractual obligations and various elements of technical
mechanisms  One of the main purposes served by these governance mechanisms is the continued
stability  functionality and interoperability of the unique and global Internet  Any improvements to
Internet governance mechanisms must at a minimum assure that continued stability  functionality and interoperability  while providing a continued evolutionary process improvement  diminished threat of
harm or other enhanced governance outcomes 
For instance  any adjustments to the current structure of the IANA contract must be considered and
conducted in a deliberate and cautious manner  to ensure that no incremental risk or instability is
introduced into IANA s functions  including the root zone management process and must recognize
and respect other existing agreements related to the IANA functions  The goal in all facets of
Internet governance is to ensure consumer and user trust in the Internet as a means of speech 
creativity  innovation and legitimate commerce 
Business stresses the need to proceed methodically and carefully with any proposed change  so as
to not impose unintended consequences and risks  In this regard  any transition process for IANA
and its functions must begin with a clear understanding of what  globalization  should mean  The
global stakeholder community would need to be fully engaged not only in developing milestones and
timelines for the  globalization  of these critical functions  but also to ensuring the reliability and
accountability of any such plan to the security and stability of the global Internet 
We welcome an opportunity to review the process by which potential issues are identified and
addressed by mechanisms in the multistakeholder environment
Business is examining how global stakeholders should pursue a voluntary  transparent  inclusive and
methodical process for considering mechanisms to addressed perceived governance or operational
problems  This process should include the following elements 
   A potential issue should be first identified to the global stakeholder community  indicating what
the implications of the issue are to governance and to determine whether the issue has
already been addressed in an existing mechanism or identify the appropriate mechanism to
address the issue 
   Once the issue has been assessed  any proposed solution should then be fully described to
the global stakeholder community 
   The proposed solution should then be analysed to determine whether it would violate the
principle of  first  do no harm  to the functionality  stability and interoperability of the unique
and global Internet 
   Finally  the solution should then be thoroughly evaluated to determine its potential
effectiveness to address the problem as well as the potential for possible unintended
consequences or burdens  Another concern for business in any Internet governance discussion is to counter the growing trend
of imposing new barriers to the growth of the Internet as a global platform for economic and social
development  In this context  business supports the development of legal rules and policy
frameworks that lead to certainty and to predictable outcomes that will foster the continued
development of the Internet as a global platform for commerce  services and content 
Business Action to Support the Information Society (BASIS)
ICC created BASIS to raise awareness among the public  governments  civil society  intergovernmental
organizations and technical community of what business requires to continue contributing to the
development of the Information Society  It serves as the voice of business in the global dialogue on the

Principles for Internet Governance

Submitted by Verizon

 

Verizon appreciates this opportunity to participate in the  Global Multi-stakeholder Meeting on the Future of Internet Governance  (NETmundial)   The Internet has become a key engine of economic growth and development around the world  and its ability to connect people is a powerful resource that must be sustained   In order to maximize its future growth  we must ensure that the Internet remains an open  stable  secure  resilient  and interoperable platform for all users  and that Internet policies allow for the free flow of information and continued innovation    In pursuit of these critical goals  we believe that preserving the multistakeholder model of Internet governance will best enable the participation of all global citizens in utilizing Internet technology and in contributing to the global dialogue on Internet issues  

 

Like many other technology companies  Verizon is looking toward the future  and is focused on improving the lives of individuals and communities through global connectivity and innovation   We are shaping our technology to band together with others to find powerful solutions to some of the world s greatest challenges  such as healthcare  education  and sustainability  which will further drive economic and social growth  

 

To meet these challenges  it is important that policies developed around the Internet are flexible and take into account the common interests of Internet users around the world   These policies should encourage innovation and investment throughout the Internet ecosystem   Internet technology is rapidly changing areas such as health care and cloud computing  and requires an environment that will continue to nurture the development of a healthy Internet ecosystem   A healthy ecosystem of connectivity  services  and content will enable market access and boost investments in infrastructure and access  We strongly believe that collaboration among a wide range of stakeholders  including the technical community  civil society  academia  governments  and businesses will produce the best Internet policy outcomes  

 

Because the Internet is by definition global  it is essential that the dialogue on the future of Internet governance include contributions from all relevant stakeholders   NETmundial provides a valuable opportunity for a wide range of stakeholders to discuss Internet governance principles that will sustain Internet growth and investment   Verizon welcomes this timely opportunity  and  to that end  we offer the following principles as part of a more comprehensive framework for Internet governance 

·                 Promote a pro-competitive environment that will foster innovation and investment  ensure an open and seamless Internet that is safe and secure  work to reduce and eliminate unnecessary barriers to trade  and act where necessary to ensure adequate protection of key public interest obligations 

·                 Ensure that policy frameworks reflect the dynamic and rapid evolution of the Internet ecosystem  and generally rely on consumer choices  competition  and multi-stakeholder bodies to guide the continued evolution and development of the Internet  

·                 Promote policies that are transparent  consistent and predictable  as well as technologically neutral 

·             Recognize the importance of continued cooperation in standards setting and in enhancing interoperability  within an international  voluntary  and consensus-based environment 

·                 Include all relevant stakeholders in developing solutions to issues essential for the development of the Internet  recognizing and taking into account public interests  economic and social goals 

·                 Support human rights  especially those relating to freedom of expression and the free flow of information on the Internet 

 

In addition to NETmundial  Internet governance will be a central focus at a number of major international conferences and smaller working group meetings this year   NETmundial offers an early opportunity for stakeholders to shape the ongoing dialogue over these critical issues to ensure the continued success of the Internet   Verizon extends its appreciation to Brazil for hosting the meeting and looks forward to participating with all stakeholders in productive dialogue on a wide range of issues related to Internet governance

The Telecommunications Industry Association Submission for NETmundial
The Telecommunications Industry Association (TIA) and its member companies would like to thank the Government of Brazil and organizers for the opportunity to submit a contribution to help facilitate the discussions at the  Global Multistakeholder Meeting on the Future of Internet Governance  (NETmundial) to be held in São Paulo  Brazil  TIA represents the global information and communications technology (ICT) industry through standards development  advocacy  policy initiatives  business opportunities  and market intelligence  With support from hundreds of members  TIA enhances the business environment for companies involved in telecommunications  broadband  mobile wireless  information technology  networks  cable  satellite  unified communications  emergency communications  and the greening of technology 
We applaud the organizers for their efforts to stay true to the principle of  the multistakeholder model  by opening this event to the global Internet community  and we look forward to the contribution of the conference to the global discussion on enhancing the multistakeholder approach to Internet governance  As governments  inter-governmental organizations  academia  the private sector  civil society  the technical community  and other stakeholders discuss the evolution of the multistakeholder approach to Internet governance  participants of NETmundial should be mindful of creating an environment that promotes sustainable growth of and global access to the Internet  In response to the invitation for submissions for the agenda of the NETmundial conference  TIA submits the following views on beginning a dialogue on identifying a set of universal Internet governance principles and developing a  Roadmap for the Further Evolution of the Internet Governance Ecosystem  
Internet Governance Principles
Today  there exists a significant body of work by a variety of stakeholders to identify Internet governance principles  beliefs  and statements  The result of these efforts has led to a variety of positions on what exactly constitutes Internet governance  which are sometimes aligned and at other times divergent  In our view  an important goal of NETmundial will be to examine the
 
variety of statements on Internet Governance and identify those principles that are universal in
nature – principles that are commonly supported by a broad spectrum of stakeholders 
Given the rapid pace of technological change and the always evolving ways that persons and
organizations make use of the Internet  it would be best to avoid principles that are overly
prescriptive as they risk obsolescence in the near term  Principles that are high-level 
technology-neutral  and focused on  the network   that is the Internet  will help ensure that any
Internet governance principles identified at NETmundial remain relevant now and into the future 
With these views in mind  TIA provides the following suggested principles for NETmundial 
• Ensure the stability  security  interoperability  and functionality of the Internet 
• Commit to the multistakeholder approach  and encourage openness and transparency in
consultative processes related to technical and policy aspects of Internet governance 
• Recognize the important economic role the Internet plays by minimizing impediments to
the global flow of information on the Internet for the delivery of online services 
applications  software  and other commercial uses 
• Promote universal access to the Internet 
• Promote voluntary  consensus-based standards that are developed in an open and
transparent manner by a broad range of standards development organizations 
• Encourage policies that stimulate investment and deployment of networks and consumer
uptake of connected devices  while avoiding policies that may distort the market and
impede investment 
Roadmap for the Further Evolution of the Internet Governance Ecosystem
We recognize that there are a broad range of existing technical and policy discussions in various
fora underway on the evolution of Internet governance  and believe that NETmundial can
supplement these ongoing dialogues  However  we urge that the conference participants and
organizers to refrain from attempting to create a specific roadmap  which could detract from
other efforts underway to evolve the governance of the Internet 
We suggest three important themes be incorporated into these discussions of a possible roadmap 
( ) the centrality of the multistakeholder approach to Internet governance  ( ) the evolution of
Internet governance is a continuing dialogue amongst a broad range of stakeholders and fora  and
( ) the current governance model has resulted in the exponential growth of the Internet  We look
 
forward to the proposals of Netmundial and its contribution to enhancing the exchange of ideas on Internet governance that will ensure the stability and continued growth of the Internet for the benefit of the global Internet community 
Practical Actions to Facilitate the Growth and Access to the Internet
While the discussion on the evolving multistakeholder approach to Internet governance is being thoughtfully considered  there are still fundamental challenges today on how to bridge the digital divide and how the public and private interests will enhance deployment of the Internet  TIA acknowledges that there are existing venues where these questions are being discussed  but the following is a non-exhaustive list of policies and practical suggestions that countries can implement today to encourage widespread investment and adoption of the Internet  including the mobile Internet 
• Promote joining the WTO Information Technology Agreement 
• Reduce tariffs on fixed and mobile telecommunications infrastructure equipment  undersea cables  and mobile devices and services 
• Remove local content requirements 
• Streamline customs procedures of ICT equipment 
• Strengthen intellectual property rights protection 
• Recognize and adopt market-based global voluntary standards  rather than country-specific standards 
TIA thanks the organizers for the opportunity to contribute to the dialogue at NETmundial  and should participants be interested in a discussion about any of the above topics or other suggestions TIA has  please contact us 

Orange contribution for the NETmundial

 

Orange has been actively involved in the Internet governance debate across many different fora for many years and is pleased to submit a Contribution as input into the Global Multi-stakeholder Meeting on the Future of Internet Governance  to be held    -    April      in Sao Paulo  Brazil 

We commend the effort deployed by the Government of Brazil to convene this NETmundial conference 

 

Orange is one of the world s leading telecommunications operators with more than     million customers worldwide and    billion euros revenues in       Orange footprint encompasses    countries both in Europe and in the Middle East Africa region and is therefore well acquainted with operational networks and internet issues in both developed and developing markets  Orange is also a leading provider of global IT and telecommunication services to multinational companies  under the brand Orange Business Services 

 

As an electronic communications provider with worldwide presence  Orange has been an active stakeholder to GSMA s and ETNO s Contributions to the NETmundial 

 

 

Internet Governance Principles

Orange supports a universal set of high-level principles relating to the Internet  The overall aim of these principles should be to restore customers  trust and digital confidence  preserve the open nature of the Internet and allow for its continued growth  resilience and stability 

 

To reach this objective  we are of the opinion that the primary focus of NETmundial should be on establishing Principles for the Governance of the Internet as opposed to Internet regulation 

 

In this respect such principles could address the need to promote  

 

- An evolved global Internet governance model  building on existing multi-stakeholder foundations and bodies  with the involvement of all relevant stakeholders  on an equal footing and in a democratic  transparent  open and collaborative manner  This governance model should be based on a multi-stakeholder accountability mechanism for all actors involved in any decision making process This model is the best suited to the dynamic nature of the Internet

 

- The sheer respect for the individual and fundamental human rights  such as privacy  freedom of speech and security  The same rule of law should apply online as it does offline and the customers should enjoy the same protection in both situations  This approach must be applied along the whole value chain and be independent of underlying technology and services

 

- The legitimacy and trust of the governance model through bolstered inclusiveness and a wider geographical representativeness  particularly vis-à-vis developing and emerging country stakeholders (governments  private sector  civil society  technical community  and academia)

 

- An economically sustainable  interconnected  secure  stable and resilient Internet 

 

 

Further Evolution of the Internet Governance Model  Roadmap

In terms of a roadmap for an evolved Internet governance model  Orange calls for a review of the multi-stakeholder model  identifying when and where various stakeholder groups should be included in policy debates 

 

The following premises could be pushed by the NETmundial 

 

- Decision-taking processes in the realm of Internet Governance need to be transparent and decision-makers must be held accountable for their decisions 

 

- The review process should seek to acknowledge and clarify the roles of the various actors and institutions in the Internet governance landscape  identifying overlapping areas where they exist  In particular  the review process should seek to define the legitimate involvement of Governments in Internet governance debates  Orange recognizes that Governments are instrumental in high-impact Internet public policy issues such as cybersecurity  privacy  child protection  intellectual property and other societal issues   

 

- The review process should also ensure that Electronic Communications operators  role be duly taken into account in any discussions affecting the Internet infrastructure  given the ever growing crucial role of connectivity functions in the Internet ecosystem 

 

- The globalisation of ICANN  including the IANA function  should continue to evolve towards a multi-stakeholder accountability framework  through a process that maintains and protects the resilience  the security and the stability of the global Internet 

In this respect Orange welcomes the program initiated by ICANN s President and Board in this field and believes it constitutes a significant step towards a better inclusion of developing and emerging country stakeholders 

Concerning the IANA function  and maintenance of the root zone  globalization means considering this function as part of the ICANN operational mission without any contractual relationship or stewardship agreement with a single Government or an only-Government structure 

The AoC should evolve to an agreement between ICANN as a legal organization and the ICANN community and stakeholders including Governments represented through the Governmental Advisory Committee 

Concerning these topics  Orange supports the recent ICANN Board s resolution to create President s Advisory Groups addressing them and ICANN President s work to reshape and globalize ICANN 

 

- It is important to address the Internet-related perceived issues  often referred as  orphan issues   for which relevant existing solution mechanisms have not be identified or for which new mechanisms  may have to be developed  

The World Information and Technology Alliance (WITSA) represents the global information and communications technologies (ICT) industry sector  The ICT sector and the Internet are now one and the same   Both enable growing trade in information goods and services and are the basis for   st century commerce and communications  and central to global economic  social and development  Wherever it is available  the Internet provides  and must continue to provide  information that reduces gaps and inequalities in health and education  The single  global Internet  not multiple national versions  enables this  and must be preserved  extended and enhanced 

 

Ensuring and maintaining the functionality  security and stability of the Internet  enhancing its speed  capacity  reach  access  interoperability and standardization are critical guiding principles for NETmundial discussions about technical  governance or policy change and are the rationale for Internet governance (IG)  centrally underlining any roadmap for the further development of the IG ecosystem 

 

The Multistakeholder model is proven effective in setting common goals  identifying issues and building shared solutions   Without politicization  the model can evolve with technology  delivering access needs of developing nations  encouraging participation from their non-government sectors  building capability and capacity 

 

Privacy and data protection are important issues subject to varying treatments in different jurisdictions  National action and cross-jurisdictional cooperation may be necessary to protectprivacy  standardize data protection regimes  build transparent legal frameworks covering access to data  and strengthen the rule of law to investigate and enforce penalties for violations  maintaining trust and confidence  Change must be undertaken carefully to avoid weakening either legitimate investigations or fundamental Internet capabilities  which equally affect trust and confidence

 
About WITSA

 

Founded in       the World Information Technology and Services Alliance (WITSA) is a leading consortium of ICT industry association members from over    countries/economies around the world  comprising industrialized and developing nations  (See map  an interactive map can be seen at http //ow ly/ukg  ) WITSA s members represent more than    per cent of the world ICT market   WITSA and its members are active participants in key Internet governance forums including the ICANN  WSIS follow-up and the IGF   ICT sector representatives play key roles in all key technical taskforces 

 

WITSA strongly supports an open  accessible and neutral Internet governed via effective  transparent multistakeholder oversight  (http //ow ly/u U K) National/regional data localization and Internet regulation proposals will impede innovation based on cloud and mobile technologies that is otherwise growing rapidly  reducing economic growth  trade and social development  including that of the public sector (http //ow ly/tV  N)   Protection of data is important to all Internet users  privacy must be safeguarded online as it is offline  and cybersecurity education and transparent legal frameworks assure the confidentiality  integrity and availability of data  thus maintaining trust and confidence  (http //ow ly/tUZQv)

Stakeholder Context

 

(Placeholder - map  Global_Internet_Time_of_Day pdf)

The Internet is a product of information and communications technology and services   Each step of its development and growth – each innovation  new capability  and enhancement of function  speed and capability – is intrinsically linked to information technologies and services developed  and deployed globally   The ICT industry sector is a key stakeholder in the development and governance of the Internet  which in turn depends on the continuous advances generated by the ICT sector  the relationship is thus a  virtuous circle   and must remain so if the functional effectiveness and efficiency of the Internet are to continue to evolve 

 

This  virtuous circle  statement positions WITSA s NETmundial contribution   governance arrangements for the Internet are de facto governance arrangements for many activities in the ICT sector  in considering any changes in governance arrangements  great care must be exercised to ensure strong incentives remain to ensure the ICT sector continues to innovate and flourish  in turn driving the digitization of economic  social and cultural activity to the benefit of all people   Internet governance arrangements directly affect trade in information goods and services  in the twenty first century  this trade significantly affects the economies of all nations  Therefore  enhancement of governance arrangements demands a comprehensive understanding of their extensive direct and indirect impact 

 
Internet Governance Principles

 

 Internet Governance  was given a working definition as part of the Tunis Agenda  which remains relevant today  One objective of the NETmundial meeting is to affirm this definition  ensuring all stakeholders understand what has been achieved  and continue to develop and apply  in their respective roles  … shared principles  norms  rules  decision-making procedures  and programmes that shape the evolution and use of the Internet "

 

WITSA welcomes the Principles for the Governance and Use of the Internet  set out by CGI br (http //ow ly/uc GL)  and also acknowledges other principles from groups of stakeholders and looks forward to the discussion about the possibility of globally accepted principles  These should be reduced to high-level principles that are generally agreed to be of critical importance   Given the  virtuous circle  context above  and drawing on the CGI br principles  WITSA ranks Functionality  security and stability  and Standardization and interoperability as primary  foundation Principles to be considered within an open  transparent Multistakeholder Governance framework  These are central to the ubiquitous nature of the Internet  and its accessibility  they provide the basis for Internet innovation  growth and development   It is WITSA s submission that the other Principles set out by CGI br rely on these critical  foundation principles 

 

WITSA therefore urges great caution in disturbing or changing governance arrangements  to avoid any actions that weaken functionality  security and stability  or reduce standardization and interoperability   Changes  if any  should instil greater trust and confidence in the Internet  and avert adverse reactions such as data localization  which will inhibit national development including the delivery of public services 

 
Roadmap for the Further Evolution of the Internet Governance Ecosystem

 

WITSA acknowledges that the evolution and growth of the Internet itself requires the evolution of Internet governance  This must not undermine the foundation Principles above  Nor should there be confusion of cause  effect  and remedy  data access and protection  which some participants may see as the underlying rationale for the NETmundial meeting  because of calls for localization of data   WITSA urges national governments to address data access and protection where necessary without inhibiting trade enabled by transborder data flows  and to work together on the cross-jurisdictional issues  (http //ow ly/tUZQv) As stated previously  it is of paramount importance changes not undermine the ubiquity  performance and future development of the Internet 

 

WITSA supports the Multistakeholder model as the best mechanism to enable issues to be identified  and to build consensus solutions   There is merit in suggestions to decentralize some of these activities in order to enhance participation  cooperation and build capacity across all nations  and particularly by non-government stakeholders in developing nations 

 

Similarly  there is merit in the idea of globalizing Internet resources including IANA  as ICANN has recently proposed   This must be considered within Multistakeholder frameworks  with transparent processes and open discussion promoted equally within all ICANN constituencies   ICANN must remain accountable to all its stakeholders during this process  which should not be politicized  WITSA urges all stakeholders including governments to exercise restraint  and to facilitate balanced discussions that lead to consensus 

 

WITSA s comments supporting decentralization and globalization above do not represent any support for recent proposals suggesting unilateral or regional data localization   It is WITSA s view such proposals are regressive  and fundamentally inappropriate remedies to protect data and privacy   If implemented  these would undermine the very basis for the Internet  and impose significant global economic and social costs  and effects 

Microsoft submission for NETmundial
March        
Microsoft welcomes the opportunity to offer input to the upcoming Global Multistakeholder Meeting on the Future of Internet Governance in Brazil  We extend our thanks and appreciation to Brazil for hosting this important meeting 
Microsoft is a worldwide leader in providing devices  services  and solutions that help people and businesses realize their full potential  Our  Putting People First  business model  which includes more than         partners worldwide  and our commitment to investing in R&D have generated millions of jobs and have helped make the IT industry one of the most vibrant sectors of the global economy  Since Microsoft s inception  we have worked to democratize computing by making IT more affordable and accessible  We are committed to putting our customers  our partners  and our communities first  investing in innovation  addressing the world s most pressing challenges  and advancing global prosperity through technology 
This meeting presents a vital opportunity for discussion that can advance the multistakeholder model of governance that has contributed to making the Internet the transformative and global resource that it is today  Where railroads and steamships were the enabling technologies for economic growth and the exchange of ideas in the   th century  the Internet is the key technology today  The Internet has transformed nearly every aspect of human society from education  and healthcare  to agriculture and manufacturing  to social discourse  and academic research 
These benefits extend to all countries  including developing and least developed countries  In      there were only     millioni Internet users worldwide  Today  nearly   billion are connected globally  This unprecedented growth rate has been accompanied by increased capacity and declining prices  and has been facilitated by the unique distributed bottom-up multistakeholder governance model that has encouraged investment in fiber and wireless facilities and allowed entrepreneurs to launch new services from anywhere on the planet  There is more work to do to connect the entire planet and  in our view  principles for Internet governance must start with the premise of strengthening what is working well and serve to accelerate access and inclusion in developing and least developed countries 
Internet Governance Principles
We note that there have been numerous efforts to craft principles for Internet governance  including the EU Commission COMPACT  the Principles for the Governance and Use of the Internet by CGI br  the OECD Principles for Internet Decision-Making  the Global Network Initiative Principles  and the APC Code of Practice on Internet Governance  There are many points of agreement across these previous efforts  and we submit that they should be carefully considered as part of the NETmundial discussions  For the discussions to be fruitful  we would urge that discussion focus on points of agreement – where meaningful progress could be made in the short timeframe of the meeting 
In our view it is imperative that all stakeholders work together to ensure the availability  stability  and vibrancy of a single  global  interconnected Internet – and to ensure that all the world s citizens are able to take advantage of it  Accordingly we support the following principles which we believe are essential 
? All the world s citizens must have access to and be empowered to realize the benefits and
transformative nature of the Internet  All stakeholders must work together to accelerate access
and inclusion for those not yet connected  At the same time policies adopted must facilitate
and encourage the needed investments in infrastructure to make such access and inclusion a
reality 
? Internet policy related decision-making activities by governments should be open and inclusive
to all stakeholders and consistent with these principles which have led to the success of the
Internet 
? The Internet s technical engineering standards should continue to be developed in a voluntary 
open  transparent  efficient  and consensus-based manner  with opportunity for all interested
stakeholders to contribute 
? The transparent  multistakeholder approach to governance  enabling all stakeholders to
participate  should be strengthened and supported at all levels  including by intergovernmental
organizations  The stability  security  interoperability  and functionality of the Internet should
be reinforced and promoted by all stakeholders 
? Universal human rights apply online just as they do offline and all citizens have the right to the
free flow of information and content and the right to freedom of expression  All stakeholders
should work together to promote and uphold universal human rights 
The Internet ecosystem is complex and multifaceted and must deal with technical  political  and social
issues  This complexity has resulted in the numerous  multistakeholder organizations and institutions
that have evolved as the Internet itself has evolved  We also note the important role that the Internet
Governance Forum (IGF) plays in providing a global  accessible platform and forum for capacity building 
awareness raising  and discussion of key issues  We strongly urge all stakeholders to continue to
support and help improve the IGF 
The multistakeholder model of Internet governance which is inclusive of all stakeholders including
business  the technical community  academics  civil society  and governments has proven to be
effective  We believe this model should continue to evolve as the Internet itself continues to evolve
with new technologies and the creation new opportunities  Together  governments and other
stakeholders should ensure that this single  global  and interoperable Internet continues to flourish
globally  reaching all of the world s citizens 
We look forward to participating in this important discussion with all stakeholders in Brazil

Executive Summary 

Mozilla offers the following comments on principles for Internet governance and suggestions for its evolution and implementation  The submission is broken into three sections  comments on putting principles for Internet governance into practice  elements of building and analyzing a roadmap for the broad Internet governance ecosystem  and original lenses and interpretations of the process of Internet governance that may help achieve an optimal balance of inclusivity and efficiency 

 

The first section discusses five important concepts for implementing Internet governance principles to preserve the Internet as an engine for global social and economic benefit  

    Do No Harm  Maintain a light touch approach to governance of the Internet s technical layers 
    Openness  Promote unrestricted global Internet communications 
    Innovation  Let use and adoption of new and/or improved Internet applications and services drive growth and policy 
    Opportunity  Allow diverse voices to participate in Internet governance with equal opportunity  and
    Competence  Incorporate ample technical expertise in all Internet governance bodies and processes 

These are not intended as proposed substitutes for the principles of others  but rather as complements to them  and ways in which to think about Internet governance principles as they are interpreted into practical structures and systems 

 

The second section addresses the current Internet governance environment  highlighting the features of it that are most important to preserving key Internet benefits for the future  In particular  a broad range of issues should be included within the scope of Internet governance  Omitting major or controversial issues would risk them being resolved by one-sided processes  or not being addressed at all  The section then explains the tensions that arise within such a broad scope of issues  and discusses the importance and value of the multiple forums that have arisen to discuss and work through these tensions 

The final section suggests that Internet governance can be conceptualized as a four-phase arc  and that functionally separating structures across these phases may be helpful to balance broad inclusion with efficiency of decision-making  In this view  the four phases are 

 

    Goal identification  Working groups and informal forums with largely like-minded stakeholders identify desired policy goals and issues 
    Policy development  Broad  inclusive  open discussion forums allow larger and diversified groups to develop views and perspectives  and to reach consensus where feasible 
    Decision-making  Ad-hoc  specifically purposed bodies make decisions regarding unresolved issues 
    Dispute resolution  Balanced  fair  inclusive mechanisms  modeled after juries or comparable bodies  resolve disagreements  including over the structure or the output of decision-making bodies  

Section    Putting Internet governance principles into practice

 

This section suggests some complementary concepts and interpretive lenses through which to implement Internet governance principles into practical structures 

Do No Harm  The first and foremost concept in putting Internet governance principles into practice must be  do no harm   Historically  the Internet s basic architectural structure has flourished  and a light touch from binding external structures has been essential for that  Any change in governance structures that would deviate from this history should be strongly discouraged  as it would put in jeopardy the significant social and economic benefits that have been delivered by the Internet 

Mozilla s mission is to build a better Internet and to promote openness  innovation  and opportunity on the Web  These goals shape Mozilla s vision for good Internet governance structures  to promote openness  innovation  and opportunity on the Internet 

 

    Openness  In the context of Internet governance  openness means promoting global communications and exchanges of ideas  and discouraging unnecessary barriers  throttles  and limits  The biggest risk in this space is balkanization or division  which would greatly hamper global growth and development and should be opposed  Internet governance principles should be interpreted in practice in a manner that supports openness of global communications and exchanges 
    Innovation  In the context of Internet governance  innovation means supporting progress and change in online technology driven by user choice  and encouraging the adoption and use of applications and services to be the primary driver of the evolution of the Internet  rather than external factors  Internet governance structures and principles in practice should be shaped and applied in a manner that encourages innovation worldwide 
    Opportunity  In the context of Internet governance  opportunity means facilitating and empowering broad  diverse  and meaningful participation from all segments of the Internet community  Internet users are not merely consumers  they are also creators  with a valid voice to develop and incorporate into Internet governance  As Internet governance principles are turned into practice through structures and bodies  they should be viewed through the lens of promoting global opportunity 

 

Substance and Process  Many  if not all  of the sets of principles developed by other organizations and collaborations that will be submitted include a mix of substance and process  Process principles describe how to conduct governance  whereas substance principles identify goals that governance processes ought to achieve  It is not always easy to separate process from substance in theory or in practice  as processes by their nature heavily influence the substance of the output of those processes  For example  substantive goals favored by civil society interests are far less likely to be advanced in the output of a process that does not include any civil society representation  However  for purposes of understanding and discussion  efforts to distinguish Internet governance principles into those that focus primarily on substance from those that focus on process may have value and may enable more productive conversations 

Competence  A separate  less broadly discussed  requirement for Internet governance is technical competence  An accurate  current technical understanding of the Internet  including such key concepts as routing  security  and storage of information  is essential as a component of major Internet governance processes in order to identify and prevent harm to the Internet s core architecture  Governance bodies must incorporate ample technical expertise at all levels  and seek to share that expertise broadly with all stakeholders 

Literacy  One of the key requirements for realization of Internet governance principles is ensuring that diverse stakeholders have not merely the opportunity for nominal participation  but in fact the literacy and the resources for effective participation  Much of this burden falls on the activities of the stakeholders  including governments  the private sector  and civil society  to support the creation and dissemination of educational materials  and the production of platforms and tools for effective engagement without requiring constant  expensive international travel  However  Internet governance structures and bodies themselves have a role to play in advancing literacy and reducing barriers to effective participation  as well  

Section    Key elements of a Roadmap for the further evolution of the Internet governance ecosystem 

This section will briefly describe the necessary breadth of scope for Internet governance  and discuss normative tensions that arise within that scope and the value of multiple forums to address those tensions 

Broad scope  The scope of issues that fall within Internet governance and policy conversations is  by necessity  extremely broad  Thought and planning exercises for Internet governance structures should aspire to match that full breadth  If the ecosystem of Internet governance structures and processes excludes issues from the outset as out of scope  the omitted issues may not see public discussion and may be resolved through less carefully constructed and thought-out processes  such as pure top-down control by one stakeholder 

Normative tensions  Key to understanding the challenges faced in a broad Internet governance ecosystem is recognizing that individual stakeholders seek to advance normatively different  sometimes incompatible  balances of interest  Viewed from that lens  one of the primary functions of Internet governance is to create processes and mechanisms by which different normative views can be developed  expressed  supported  and opposed (where relevant) by the universe of Internet interests  so that consensus can be found where possible  and where not  disputes and disagreements can be resolved in a fair  inclusive  and accurate manner 

Multiple forums  There is no one forum  body  or structure best suited to fully address every issue within the full scope of Internet governance  No single institution or process can handle all the diverse aspects of Internet governance because there is no possible perfect balance of inclusiveness and concrete decision-making  and no possible perfect balance among all the stakeholders who would need to be satisfied to achieve the essential legitimacy  Instead  a broad array of forums and bodies has been created over recent years  and it is this diversity that Internet governance reform conversations properly begin from 

Section    Functional separation of Internet governance phases

This section will describe the Internet governance process as a  -phase arc as a way of facilitating understanding and building practical governance structures  It will then explain the potential benefits of functional separation across the phases to allow for a balance of inclusivity in discussion and efficacy in decision-making  

 -Phase arc  To build structures that help advance the right principles  it may be helpful to understand the flow of Internet governance as a  -phase arc  phases which may be either conflated or separated in their execution in practice   ) goal identification   ) discussion and development of policy   ) decision-making processes to resolve normative differences  and  ) dispute resolution mechanisms  

   Goal identification  The overall process of Internet governance begins when individuals  organizations  or aligned parties and interests identify goals to pursue through Internet governance bodies or structures  Universal awareness and education of policy issues and contexts is the biggest challenge in practice to successful goal identification 

   Policy development  Through policy discussion and development  diverse interests come together in one or more Internet governance forums or bodies to discuss an issue or a range of issues  learn more about the overlaps or dissimilarities in their preferred normative outcomes  and adopt (possibly divergent) views on whether specific possible policy changes are sufficiently acceptable  In this phase  many of the Internet governance principles come to the fore  such as inclusivity  equal opportunity  and empowerment of all those who have a stake in the relevant issues 

   Decision-making  The third phase includes decision-making structures and processes that can take policy discussions into determinations of action (or inaction)  In some contexts  the same forums that handle policy development and discussion adequately produce many decisions as well  But in many others  particularly those that involve difficult public policy issues such as human rights where divergent interests cannot agree  development and discussion forums built for inclusiveness do not extend well to efficient and tractable decision-making  without simply ignoring or overruling some voices 

   Dispute resolution  The fourth phase of the arc is the backstop for problems that may arise from decision-making structures or processes  Disputes will arise no matter how carefully structured the policy discussion and decision bodies and processes today or for years to come  Currently  the Internet governance ecosystem contains few dispute resolution mechanisms adequate to handle such a challenge  to hear and resolve grievances between hugely different types of interests 

Functional separation  One way of understanding some objections to the current Internet governance ecosystem is that many forums for discussion are not built for efficient decision-making  Rather than try to graft decision-making capabilities onto forums that are successful at managing inclusive policy discussion and development  functional separation of decision-making may in many cases be the best approach  into a separate process  body  or forum that includes key multi-stakeholder voices yet is structured primarily to produce a decision rather than to maximize inclusion  In that way  inclusiveness need never be limited at the outset of policy discussion  and if there is a possible consensus  it can occur before narrowing the scope of inclusion in the conversation  But  when discussion fails  a subsequent process may be invoked to achieve a decision  taking the output of discussion processes into account  

Dynamic decision-making  The notion of less-inclusive decision-making bodies poses significant risk of abuse of power and poor outcomes  because to be efficient and effective such bodies will often pick a winner and a loser  or try to craft a compromise solution  An ideal approach to reducing capture of such a body by a specific interest  or set or category of interests  would be to make decision-making bodies strictly ad hoc  dynamic  and temporary  creating a new body only after the failure of voluntary and consensus processes  constructing the body purely to address a single issue or discrete set of related issues  and subjecting each one to a strict termination date 

 

Stable dispute resolution  Dispute resolution mechanisms must themselves reflect the key principles applicable to policy development and decision-making forums  In particular  to be viewed as legitimate  they must be multi-stakeholder  accountable  transparent  and inclusive  among other values  Yet  to allow potentially thousands of distinct interests to all have voice in resolving every dispute would bog down Internet governance processes interminably  Thus  one model worth considering may be to build and legitimize a large pool of potential  jurors   perhaps large enough to include balanced representation from all interested parties  from which an odd-numbered subset would be chosen at random to resolve each dispute  Such a stable  inclusive  balanced dispute resolution structure or set of structures could serve to balance the risks of capture and abuse of power that would otherwise rise from decision-making bodies  and to create stability and equality of opportunity among all interests 

SUSTAINING PRINCIPLES FOR INTERNET POLICY AND GOVERNANCE

Submitted by Cisco Systems

This paper is submitted on behalf of Cisco Systems  Inc ( Cisco )  Cisco is the worldwide leader in networking equipment and our hardware  software and solutions provide the foundation of the Internet 

 

As a company  we have long supported an open and innovative Internet with governance principles that are open  transparent and representative of all stakeholders 

 

The extraordinary success of the Internet is not an accident  It is precisely the open and competitive nature of the Internet  alongside the decentralized and multi-stakeholder mechanisms associated with its governance  that have been instrumental in enabling this platform to grow and become the most powerful catalyst for growth and innovation 

 

We believe this decentralized structure and multi-stakeholder governance  strengthened as necessary  will continue to enable economies and societies to reap the rewards of an accessible  ubiquitous  fast and affordable Internet 

 

In light of the forthcoming  Global Multi-stakeholder Meeting on the Future of Internet Governance  to be held in São Paulo in April  we would like to restate our support for the global multi-stakeholder  market-based and decentralized nature of Internet governance  We believe the following principles are essential to Internet governance 

·      The Internet is for everyone  for the betterment of everyone  

·Policies must support transparency and openness in intergovernmental organizations and multi-stakeholder mechanisms  to ensure that all stakeholders can participate meaningfully in key Internet policy discussions  The quality of Internet governance decisions increases when more and diverse stakeholders choose to actively and consistently participate 

·Policies must ensure a safe  secure  open  interoperable  and sustainable Internet 

·      A safe and secure Internet will enhance confidence and trust in the Internet and policies should support implementation of best practices in relation to network security 

·      Individuals and organizations should be able to trust the Internet infrastructure to connect one another in a manner in which the privacy of communications is respected 

 

·      Policies must support opening and maintaining international markets in a way that allows for the free flow of data  digital services  applications  products  and information  both within and across national borders 

 

·      The technical means by which the Internet is operated and information exchanged  should be managed by technical experts 

·Policies must stimulate sustainable investment in and deployment of networks ?and the industries and services that create demand for those networks 

·Policies must support capacity building and broaden inclusion by those who are not yet participants in the broader Internet and Internet governance process  in particular from developing countries 

Cisco looks forward to working with all stakeholders to prepare for a successful meeting in Brazil  and to be part of the ongoing global dialogue on Internet governance

Global Multistakeholder Meeting on the Future of Internet Governance

 

Internet Infrastructure Coalition (i Coalition)

 

The i Coaltion appreciates the opportunity to provide comments to the Global Multistakeholder Meeting on the Future of Internet Governance   The i Coalition s unique place within the Internet ecosystem gives it great insight into the impact of the current Internet Governance model  the issues facing that model  and proposals to change or reform the model 

 

The i Coalition supports those who build the nuts and bolts of the Internet  and we treat it like the noble profession that it is  We believe the continued growth of the Internet is vital for growing an environment of innovation and seek to engage in ways to foster success of the Internet and Internet infrastructure industry  We seek to foster growth within the Internet infrastructure industry by driving others to harness the Internet s full potential 

 

The i Coalition has a deep interest in the way the Internet is  governed   Each of our member companies is affected by decisions made in regard to Internet governance  and we are increasingly involved in the institutions created by the Internet community to guide the development of the Internet  It is our firm belief that participation in these processes is not only a civic duty  but also an economic necessity 

 

Below are principles that we  as a coalition  believe are needed for discussions of Internet Governance 

 

Section     Internet Governance Principles

 

    Internet Governance works best when specialized groups are involved  allowing individual groups to focus on issues specific to their knowledge base and then sharing with one another  utilizing specializations 

    Governments have a role as equals in Internet Governance  but should not have  veto power  in governance fora 

    Businesses provide support for the Internet  and are fundamental to ensuring its success   Economic principles govern business decisions   Providing an environment for investment will facilitate Internet development 

 

    Internet Governance entities should be focused on their  remit    There is a danger that the Internet Governance system will become overly politicized 

 

    Several documents and statements currently exist that the i Coalition agrees are particularly appropriate to a set of universal principles  including 

 

o   The Modern Paradigm for Standards (Open-Stand org s Prinicples)

 

o   European Commission Vice President Neelie Kroes  Compact for the Internet

 

 Section     Roadmap for the Further Evolution of the Internet Governance Ecosystem

 

 i Coalition Overview of Internet Governance

 

The Internet was created from the bottom up  Those initially building the Internet did so on a collaborative basis  sharing ideas and debating the best methods to operate the network  These processes continue today in a variety of areas  people discussing Internet standards  naming and numbering policies  peering and interconnection and many other technical and administrative issues 

 

Why Participation in Internet Governance is Important

 

The i Coalition believes that business plays a critical role in shaping Internet governance 

 

The vast majority of the Internet s infrastructure is owned or operated by private entities  While these entities have a civic duty to develop the Internet  they are also driven to move their business forward  Participation in the collaborative Internet governance process is critical to ensuring that the Internet remains a positive place to do business and that all businesses regardless of location are able to grow and flourish 

 

Those using and benefiting from the Internet must work together to ensure its continued success and viability   By doing so  the Internet will remain a robust place to exchange ideas  create new businesses  and develop economies in a way that is unprecedented  and offers significant opportunities for those without significant development resources 

 

The i Coalition believes that the following principles of Internet governance are key to a thriving and robust Internet 

 

    Governance of the Internet is best undertaken by specialized groups  The Internet has thrived because technical experts have led its governance  Groups like the W C and IETF focus almost exclusively on technical standards  These standards are designed to optimize the functionality and resiliency of the Internet  and not serve a particular entrenched technology or set of standards  This has allowed the creation of an open and free Internet in which one or a small set of businesses do not dominate 

 

    Governments deserve a seat at the table  Some issues affecting the Internet cannot be resolved by entities other than governments  Governmental entities should be treated as equals among all stakeholders in multistakeholder processes  No participant in Internet governance should be given veto power over any decision 

 

    Internet governance must be transparent  Decisions made by governance bodies must be made openly in public forums  using a consensus-based process with significant opportunity for debate 

 

    The development of the Internet should continue to be done at the edge of the network  by end users  and not mandated by governmental or intergovernmental entities  Internet infrastructure providers have a unique viewpoint into the development possibilities the Internet provides  For most U S  providers  over fifty percent of their business comes from outside the United States  As this business grows  these providers establish a presence outside the U S  to be closer to their customers   Because of the investment involved in establishing Internet infrastructure  development cannot be forced  It will only come when small Internet businesses grow  making infrastructure investments viable 

 

Issues Presented for the Internet Governance Ecosystem and Areas for Improvement

 

The Internet governance process is at an inflection point   While we believe that the past success of the multistakeholder model of Internet governance  we see increasing calls for change   Those calling for change appear to seek to replace this governance structure with one favoring a top down regulatory approach in which governmental entities  or quasi-governmental entities  dictate rules  regulations and technical standards   Such a change would exclude groups like the i coalition and its members who have designed  funded  operated and participated in the governance structure of the Internet   Further  the rapid pace of innovation is well suited to the multistakeholder model   It is not well suited to a top down  regulatory based model of governance    Such a model is not narrowly focused enough to be nimble and swiftly address issues in  Internet time  

 

Internet infrastructure providers have a significant interest in the continued security  stability and reliability of the Internet   Even with this interest  we recognize that other interests have a seat at the table   We believe that the current model of Internet governance facilitates the discussion and prioritization of interests better than a top down  nation based  governmental structure 

 

Although Internet governance may appear to be abstract and removed from day-to-day business operations  businesses ignore it at their peril  Some issues that are currently being debated that directly affect Internet infrastructure businesses  yet are being harmfully conflated with other subjects  include 

 

 

    In-country requirements  Governments should not mandate that all or some content remain in a particular jurisdiction   The Internet has thrived in a one-to-many environment   This environment has not only revolutionized the way the world conducts commerce  it has amplified the ability of those seeking to communicate with others to disseminate their views    Data localization requirements and content controls are solutions seeking a problem 

 

    Intermediary liability  Those creating content should bear liability for its creation and dissemination    Intermediary liability creates a barrier to new businesses  and entrenches already existing businesses   Imposing liability on intermediaries also creates a disincentive to invest in jurisdictions that seek to equate transmission of data with its creation   Imposing liability on intermediaries would stymie the growth of new businesses by creating an incentive for businesses to only provide services to safe  and not disruptive  businesses 

 

    Politicization of the process   Internet technical standards have generally developed away from political issues   While no issue is totally free of politics  allowing those participating in technical standards organizations to create standards away from political and diplomatic pressures is a key factor in the continued development and stability of the Internet 

 

    Adding additional  potentially unnecessary layers of governance to the Internet Governance process with a finite amount of participants   As the Internet grows  there is some need for the organizations providing support to its governance to also expand   However  great care must be exercised that those responsible for facilitating the governance of the Internet do not themselves become the governance   In addition  increasing layers of staff may isolate those operating businesses from the ability to make effective  and swift  decisions   The current governance structure may need to be refined to better address the needs of participants who seek to use the structure to address problems that they believe affect the Internet as a whole 

 

    Inability of the process  and participants  to welcome new participants and ideas  The current governance structure appears complicated and opaque to new entrants   As a new entrant in the process  the i Coalition has experienced this issue recently   In particular  technologies that facilitate communication and dissemination of information are not common within governance structures   Corporatized communications solutions that are appropriate for high level government needs may not be necessary  or nimble enough  to facilitate the high level of communication needed for globally distributed Internet businesses and users to participate   Further  remote participation is often difficult and perceived by governance participants as secondary  or reflective of a lack of interest  than in-person attendance at meetings  

 

Meetings and gatherings that form the basis of Internet governance should not be hierarchical  complicated gatherings requiring multiple layers of authentication and identity verification   Widely available and widely used technologies should be favored over proprietary solutions that require technical expertise to use   To facilitate participation by those who do not have significant resources  remote participation tools (in particular) should use technologies that may be installed on shared resources such as internet cafes or on handheld devices 

 

The i Coalition recommends that at a minimum Internet governance organizations offer  newcomer  sessions that have been designed by individuals skilled in soliciting new entrants into unique processes   Further that these sessions be designed to reflect the global nature of the Internet  and include facilitation of remote participation as an equal 

 

Fora for Internet Governance processes

 

The specialization of Internet governance entities has been key to its success   This specialization has allowed these entities to respond quickly to new developments and technologies in a way that is not available to established regulatory entities   We believe that Internet stakeholders will be able to rely on these entities to solve new problems  and that a new model  or additional governance bodies  are not necessary 

 

The major entities involved in Internet coordination are  the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN)  the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF)  the Internet Architecture Board (IAB)  the World Wide Web Consortium (W C) and the Internet Society (ISOC)  There are hundreds of lesser known organizations actively involved including root-server operators  DNS registries  Internet Exchange Points and IP address registries (regional and local) 

 

As noted above  the solution to the issue of how to handle the inflection point that faces the Internet may not be to create new institutions  but to help users  particularly new users  use existing structures    To do so  we recommend that those participating  using and critiquing governance structures 

    Create models that allow new entrants to effectively interface with them without a significant learning curve or isolation 

    Embrace the capacity building examples provided by the IETF and ISOC 

    Welcome transparency   The default standard for all organizations that touch the Internet should be for open meetings  transparency and inclusion   Attendance should be encouraged  documents should be disseminated without cost  and platforms should be available to the technically unsophisticated and economically disadvantaged  

Intel Comments for NETMundial

 

Intel commends Brazil for convening and hosting this important dialog on the critical topic of internet governance and is pleased to submit these comments  Intel is the world's largest semiconductor chip maker  Since      we have developed the chips and technology that power the worldwide digital economy  In this submission we would first like to offer some comments on the logistics and work of the meeting  and then provide proposals on the principles and roadmap 

 

 COMMENTS ON THE WORK OF THE MEETING

 

Do No Harm – Help All 

          The global community  as gathered in the United Nations   th General Assembly  acknowledged in Resolution   /     the steady increase in Internet access to one third of the world s population  the rapid diffusion of mobile telephony and mobile Internet  the increased availability of multilingual content and the advent of many information and communications technologies services and applications  which offer great potential for the development of the information society   It went on to stress  however  the  need to close the digital divide  including with regard to such issues as Internet affordability  and to ensure that the benefits of new technologies  especially information and communications technologies  are available to all   Intel believes these two statements should serve as buoys to guide the way forward for the work of NETmundial and the global discussion in general  The meeting should seek to  do no harm  to the vibrant  innovative  and competitive market for products  services  and ideas  that has brought the benefits of technology to billions  while striving to expand those benefits to all 

 

Stay Focused

 

Secondly  the large number and great diversity of participants  importance of the topic  and very short duration will preclude extended discussion of detailed proposals  In order to achieve consensus  the meeting should focus on high-level principles and concepts  Organization- specific contributions  such as detailed ICANN proposals  should be remanded to those specific organizations 

 

Sunshine Process  

 

Finally  for the output of the meeting to gain wide support and legitimacy  it must reflect a true consensus of the stakeholders  There is currently some lack of transparency in fundamental aspects of the meeting  such as how participants are chosen to attend  how representatives of various constituencies were designated  and how output documents will be deemed approved  It is important that a clear understanding exists at the start of the meeting of the mechanisms NETmundial will use to ensure that any output reflects true consensus  

 

COMMENTS ON PRINCIPLES

 

As recognized by all  many organizations have produced Internet-related principles such as UN General Assembly  OECD  UN Human Rights Council  the G  and others  Some commenters have derived principles based on a synthesis of these earlier principles  Given that global discussion around these basic ideas has reached some level of maturity  we believe the meeting should be able to arrive at a consensus on a set of principles  In our submission we would just like to highlight two principles we consider foundational to the continued growth of the Internet  

 

Commitment to the Multistakeholder Approach

 

From our vantage point as one of the innovators and key suppliers of technology to the ICT industry for over forty years  Intel is keenly aware of the efficiency  flexibility  and resiliency of a multistakeholder approach  especially in the area of day-to-day operations and technical standards  One of the greatest market challenges was the coordination of hundreds of thousands of hardware manufacturers with millions of software and application developers to produce interoperable products  while delivering constant innovation  Yet a distributed  industry driven approach  where technologies and products are tried on their technical and market merits has been able to deliver capabilities to consumers that were considered science fiction just decades ago  Moreover  this development and standardization process  which is close to the end-user  is also crucial for rapidly responding to cyber security attacks and threats  Intel realizes the role of governments in addressing communities that may be underserved by the market  for instance  through the use of Universal Service programs  However  Intel strongly opposes the replacement of existing organizations and technical bodies  or the arrogation of the functions of those bodies  by a new or existing intergovernmental body  

 

Open Internet

 

Intel supports the principle (submitted by Germany) that  The global  open and free nature of the Internet as a single commons has to be ensured  It is a driving force for progress towards development in its various forms including economic growth  encouraging innovation and allowing for creativity   We have been greatly concerned by recently proposed unilateral actions that would fundamentally alter the single commons nature of the Internet by enforcing localization mandates  Similar to proposals during WCIT to replace industry agreements with government-imposed sending-party-pays regimes  localization requirements seek to alter a fundamental aspect of the internet for parochial benefit that would result in negative consequences for all parties involved  The ability to establish  virtually  a global footprint has been a key driver for the growth of many commercial enterprises  Germany s mittelstand in particular have benefited significantly on the low barrier to entry to become an international leader  These companies would significantly suffer if localization mandates required a physical presence in every market they served  Also  end users could lose access to products and services and see rising costs due to reduced competition  Moreover forums for the free expression and exchange of ideas could be devastated by laws which would dramatically increase operating costs   We believe data security is not a question of server location but of standardized and harmonized security technologies  policies  and practices which enable interoperability and involve all stakeholders developing flexible approaches and mechanisms to improve cyber-security  We strongly support  however  the announcement to lay an undersea cable between Europe and South America  Such capacity-building would facilitate better access for the countries involved and improve access  resiliency  and security for the entire virtual community   

 

COMMENTS ON THE Roadmap for the Further Evolution of the Internet Governance Ecosystem

 

Inform Not Dictate

 

The title of this discussion topic was appropriately chosen  As defined in the OED Evolution is  …the rise or origination of anything by natural development as distinguished from its production by a specific act    The evolution of the multistakeholder Internet governance ecosystem has been an ongoing process as the existing individual organizations have responded to their changing environment  The companies  communities and governmental and non-governmental bodies that constitute Internet Governance engage in internal assessment and improvement on a regular basis  It is crucial that this process remains a bottoms-up progression  This meeting and similar forums can  should  and will influence that evolution  but reconfiguring  realigning or redistributing governance functions by external fiat would have a detrimental and long lasting impact 

 

As technology advances developers and innovators utilize new capabilities to create ever improving and new applications and products  Simultaneously  dramatic cost reductions and new access technologies allow the benefits of the Internet and ICTs to flow to an ever increasing percentage of the world s population  In addition  negative activities such as malicious cyber security attacks occur requiring immediate attention  And so a fundamental requirement for all companies  standards bodies  and policy setting organizations in the ICT Industry is their ability to adapt to change  Moreover  the processes these organizations use to improve themselves are often open consultations where all stakeholders have the means to provide input 

 

For instance ICANN    in Durban  South Africa  created five new Strategy Panels to  build on public input being generated to inform a new  overarching vision and five-year strategic plan  and subsequent operating plan  for the organization   The panels  providing recommendations and guidance for the operation and future of ICANN are directly relevant to this discussion  especially  ICANN s Role in the Internet Governance Ecosystem   which recently published a comprehensive report including a Roadmap towards Globalization  Intel commends the work of the panel and recognizes the internal  consultation process (stakeholders are encouraged to review all the draft reports and provide comments through    April     ) as the best and only legitimate mechanism for positive change  We believe it would be counterproductive for this meeting to prescribe (top down) specific changes for ICANN or any individual organization  While this meeting should note the detailed proposals have been submitted to this meeting related to modifications to ICANN  ICANN    and internal forums are the appropriate place for their discussion 

 

Role of governments

 

Unquestionably  an issue dominating the global discussion has been the role of governments in Internet governance  Internet activity  like all human activity  requires a sphere of security and certainty established by the rule of law in order to flourish  However  inside that sphere  freedom and flexibility are critical to foster the innovation needed to realize the potential of technology  This concept is enshrined in Article    of the Tunis Agenda which recognizes 

 

 the need for enhanced cooperation in the future  to enable governments  on an equal footing  to carry out their roles and responsibilities  in international public policy issues pertaining to the Internet  but not in the day-to-day technical and operational matters  that do not impact on international public policy issues  

 

Intel has a long history of fruitful engagement with Administrations to expand the benefits of ICTs to all segments of society  Our Intel World Ahead program has worked extensively with governments to adopt policies designed to accelerate broadband adoption  for instance  via the development of national broadband plans  and improvements in the use of Universal Service Funds  And we work with governments  stakeholders  and ecosystem partners to promote capacity-building  as in the area of education where Intel s Teach professional development program has enabled    million teachers to effectively integrate technology into their lessons to promote problem-solving  critical thinking and collaboration skills among their students 

 

However intergovernmental organizations are poorly structured to address most technical and operational aspects of the dynamic and fluid Internet and ICT environment  The current system  while not perfect  largely allows decisions to be made based on their technical or market merit  It also provides timely feedback to inform investment on those products and services most valued by consumers (Intel alone has invested over $    Billion during the WSIS period to maintain the daunting pace of Moore s law)  Perhaps most importantly  the existing multi-stakeholder model provides the speed and flexibility needed to address and combat cyber-security attacks and threats  Replacing the current system with a cumbersome  bureaucratic process requiring decisions based on the agreement of Administrations  would not only stifle innovation and progress  and lead to sub-optimal technologies  products and services  but could also lessen overall confidence and security in the use of ICTs  Accordingly  as mentioned above  Intel strongly opposes the replacement of existing organizations and technical bodies  or the arrogation of the functions of those bodies  by a new or existing intergovernmental body  

 

 

IN SUMMARY

·        The meeting should be guided by the tenet  do no harm   while it seeks to increase and disseminate the benefits of ICTs and the Internet 

·        At the outset  the meeting should clarify the processes used for designating representatives of various stakeholder groups and the mechanisms that will be used to draft and achieve consensus on any output documents 

·        We consider the principles of multi-stakeholder approach and an open Internet as foundational 

·        The evolution of the Internet governance ecosystem should be endogenous  that is  informed by external forums  but not dictated by them 

·        Existing or new functions should not be bestowed on an existing or new inter-governmental organization 

Submission of Internet Governance Principles

 

 

Abstract 

Our Association support the multi-stakeholder model approach to promote the progress of Internet and its governance  The making policy and the way to govern the internet should be open to all interested individuals  communities and organizations without any prejudice and without favor and should be inclusive to make process 

Mainbody text 

 

    Internet governance should be open to all the people not only who use and are interested in now   but also will use and will be interested in the future  And of course it should be based on multi-stakeholder  bottom-up and consensus-making process 
    Transparent  accountable  inclusive and meaningful participationAll stakeholders have the right to know/understand the reason of the decisions and its process  And the system (open to all stakeholders) to oversee the decision making process will help to reflect the opinions and increase transparency  The accountable system will produce the meaningful participation without unproductiveness 
    Respect for Human Rights Human rights is the most important issue of Internet Governance  In the similar context  the privacy and the Freedom of Expression should be considered as the same importance  Freedom of communication is a fundamental right 
    Respect for Diversity In the progress of Internet Governance  those matters should be deliberate  balance of gender  locality  Nationality  religion  species  class and so on  And also we should consider the linguistic diversity  As we have new gTLD program will make a chance to non-English community to use its own language  IDN(Internationalized Domain Name) program is one of the good practice  although it has many agendas

We agree with the spirits of the Montevideo Statement on the Future of Internet Cooperation  The outreach efforts to promote the Internet Governance attitude should be more activated for the better understanding and participations 

Main body text 

    We support the spirit of the Montevideo Statement Global multi-stakeholder cooperation will enhance the evolution of Internet Governance challenges  The enhancement of ICANN and IANA function will be one of the most important issues  And more participation in this field should be needed    It is important to make it open and inclusive for policy making of Internet Critical Resources  These frameworks should be strengthened by involving more stakeholders In order to reach global consensus on new oversight and policy development framework on ICANN/IANA functions  we suggest to set up Working Groups consist of all stakeholders with geographic  gender and other diversity considerations to come up with possible alternatives to be considered at the coming IGF      process 
    The outreach effort of Internet Governance should be expanded  For instance  marginal people and/or communities should be supported by the appropriate institutions  financially and technically to provide the developing policy of Internet Governance  This will help not only the marginals but also the existing organizations  communities and individuals to promote the better understanding and evolving the Internet governance 
    Local/Global Dialog and Best practice share The continuous  local and global dialog on Internet Governance will be effective to make a consensus of Internet Governance  These dialogs should be open to all stakeholders and disclosed  Especially the institutional activities about Critical Internet Resources should be transparent and fare  The sharing the experiences with all stakeholders will strongly promote the evolution of Internet Governance 
    Capacity building and Support  To achieve the goal of Internet Governance policy making  not only financial support but human support will need for developing and heightening the international momentum toward comprehension and engagement of Internet Governance Internationally 

Facebook NetMundial Submission

 

Submitted for Consideration to the Global Multi-stakeholder Meeting on the Future of Internet Governance

 

March     

 

We are pleased to be able to provide comments for the Global Multi-Stakeholder Meeting on the Future of Internet Governance  or NETmundial  and respectfully submit the following perspectives for consideration  

 

Facebook s mission is to give people the power to share and make the world more open and connected  The Internet has enabled people to connect with each other in ways unknown before  and has been a transformative force creating immense social and economic value  We recognize that the existing value of the Internet and its future potential lies in its open and unfragmented nature  and believe that preserving this open environment should be foundational to Internet governance  

 

Connecting the Next Five Billion

 

The knowledge economy is the future of the world economy   It is built on knowledge and ideas  resources that are renewable and available to everyone   Because of this  in a knowledge economy  the most important resources are the talented people we educate 

 

The Internet plays a critical role in the acceleration of the knowledge economy  A new Deloitte report (Deloitte LLP   Value of connectivity  Economic and social benefits of expanding internet access   February       London) estimated that increasing access in developing countries could generate more than $    trillion in additional GDP  create more than     million new jobs  lift     million people out of poverty  reduce child mortality by  %  and give     million children access to cost effective learning tools and resources  

 

Deloitte has found that  for example   in India  farmers and fishermen tracking weather conditions and comparing wholesale prices through mobile phones increased their profits by  % and better access to information resulted in a  % drop in prices for consumers   Further   In countries as diverse as Mexico  Malaysia and Morocco  SMEs with internet access have been found to have experienced an average   % productivity gain  Extending Internet access to levels seen in developed countries today means that long run productivity could be enhanced by as much as   % in developing economies  

 

Currently  however  only   out of every   people have regular access to the Internet  If we can bring the remaining two thirds of the world online  and ensure that those who are online maintain the freedom necessary to connect  share and innovate  we can fundamentally advance the well being of the global population  

 

Lasting Principles for the Future of Internet Governance

 

Because the Internet can play such a critical role for people s social and economic well-being  stakeholders in all countries should be able to trust and participate equally in Internet governance structures  

 

We believe that we can make significant progress towards global trust and participation by building on current models of Internet governance   These models have served us well and we should focus on how they can be made more effective and representative  To this end  we support a) bolstering the transparency and accountability of current Internet governance bodies  b) encouraging capacity building so that relevant communities in all countries can fully engage in Internet governance  and c) taking steps to reach out to underrepresented stakeholders to ensure that all sectors are at the table 

 

In order to maintain momentum in extending access and the benefits of connectivity to the whole global population  we must remain committed to a free and open Internet that connects billions of people in an affordable way and without hindrance by national borders or other artificial barriers  Any work to modify the current architecture of the Internet should be cautious  consultative  and operate through the multistakeholder process  We should avoid sacrificing quality to speed  and we see the NetMundial as an opportunity to carefully advance ongoing and parallel discussions throughout the world on the future of Internet governance 

 

With this in mind  we join with other industry associations in support of the following consensus principles 

 

  Commitment to a free and open Internet  

  Continuing the free flow of information that is critical for innovation  

  Expanding access to broadband networks so that all of the world s citizens can contribute to the knowledge economy 

  Combatting efforts to impose physical or technological barriers on information  

  Working to decrease the economic barriers to internet connectivity 

  Commitment to a multistakeholder approach to governance 

  Commitment to transparent governance  

  Assuring the continuing security  stability  and resiliency of the Internet 

 

Conclusion

 

At Facebook  we believe that connecting the world is a fundamental challenge and opportunity for our generation  Right now the Internet connects a third of humanity – we think it should connect everyone  When everyone can participate in the global knowledge economy  all of us will benefit from the ideas and productivity they contribute to the world  Together  innovators  governments  civil society  and global citizens have been taking impressive strides in this direction  To keep moving forward  we should guard against unnecessary barriers and preserve the Internet as a single  open  free network of networks for everyone

Deutsche Telekom s Contribution to the Global Multistakeholder Meeting on the Future of Internet Governance

 

Deutsche Telekom welcomes the initiative from the Brazilian Government to organize the Global Multistakeholder Meeting on the Future of Internet Governance  which also finds broad Governmental support from various regions of the World  This broad commitment shows that the initiative is timely and the topics at stake are highly relevant  We understand and support the objectives of the Global Multistakeholder Meeting to define concrete and actionable steps to shape the future of Internet Governance 

 

Due to its global nature and its increasing political  societal and economic relevance it is important to establish a sustainable global Internet Governance model able to address today s and future challenges  The latest preparatory meeting for this year s European Internet Governance Forum EuroDIG (European Dialogue on Internet Governance) in Berlin has revealed two major concerns  How to re-establish trust and how to enforce the rule of law in the Internet 

 

Security  data protection  privacy and the rule of law in the online world are crucial to ensure the sustainability of the whole ecosystem  Deutsche Telekom believes that the deliberation on basic principles should include issues such as rules for privacy  data protection and the effective protection of fundamental rights in the online world  Reaching a consensus on these important aspects by agreeing on such basic principles would represent an important step towards enhanced trust in the digital world 

 

The Internet would not exist without the constant efforts of network operators throughout the world to built and modernise infrastructures  Mobile networks are an important example  Without the large scale deployment of mobile networks in developing countries internet connectivity would be there on very low levels  Nevertheless  this seems to be taken for granted  without honouring the efforts and significant investments by network operators or even ignoring the underlying economics  But the ability of network operators to serve the general public with universally available access to  and state of the art delivery of data within the Internet is closely linked to the economic viability of future business models  The current state of the Internet Economy is characterized by significant asymmetries between those building the infrastructure and those making extensive commercial use of it without an appropriate and proportionate financial contribution 

 

Where global issues are at stake  we welcome moves to internationalise the Internet Governance ecosystem  The globalization of the Internet needs to be reflected in appropriate governance mechanisms and institutional settings that represent in an appropriate  transparent and balanced way the interests of all who share this global resource 

Basic principles for the Internet may include

·         preserving the high value of the Internet for the democratization of our societies in providing protection of basic human rights also in the online world

·         ensuring the freedom of global communication and global access to information

·         reinforcing the well established principle of secrecy of communication in the Internet

·         establishing a high and effective level of protection of personal data

·         decrease the unnecessary and burdensome centralisation by introducing the principle of subsidiarity  favouring for example an  Internet of short distances  to improve the protection of the privacy  to prevent illegal collection of data and to restore trust in the digital world

·         ensuring a high level protection against cyber attacks or cyber crime

·         ensuring the sustainability of continued investments and innovation in the underlying infrastructures

Roadmap for the further evolution of the Internet Governance ecosystem

·         The meeting in Brazil could foster the ongoing process of the internationalisation of ICANN and the IANA functions  e g 

Ø      in identifying how to best globalise the IANA functions  whilst safeguarding the continued stability and security of the domain-name system 

Ø      in establishing a clear timeline for the globalisation of ICANN 

·         We very much support an open multi-stakeholder model  However  there is still room for improvement of the existing multi-stakeholder approach  in particular regarding transparency  legitimacy and balanced and representative participation 

·         When it comes to concrete and actionable outcomes of any process  we need some basic rules to deliver sufficient legitimacy 

·         Such basic rules can be developed in the future into a sustainable governance model based upon International public law principles  The evolution of international trade law under the GATT regime might serve as a role model for this 

NETmundial-Global Multistakeholder Meeting on the Future of Internet Governance
  -  th April  Sao Paulo  Brazil 
COAI Proposal
A  Internet Governance
   The phenomenal growth of the Internet has facilitated individual empowerment
and access to information  goods and services across borders  it has lowered
entry barriers and supported the rapid development of small and medium sized
enterprises  it has generated jobs for millions of people  In sum  the Internet has
led to significant benefits to the society and the economy 
   The Internet in India has only taken   years to grow from a subscribers  base of
    million to     million  This has been catalysed by the growth of wireless
telecom networks in India  On the back of higher adoption of mobile devices as
a means to access the Internet according to the I-Cube      report  the number
of Internet users in India is expected to reach     million by June       India is
also expected to overtake the US as the second largest Internet base in the world
by the same time  The robust growth is a result of fast growing Internet
ecosystem with a multitude of local and global players and a thriving Internet
economy 
   Mobile Internet is going to be the game changer for Internet in India  Compared
to     percent mobile Internet users in       the penetration has grown to    
percent  indicating a substantial growth in the mobile Internet user penetration
levels  The National Telecom Policy (NTP)      envisages broadband penetration
to reach     million connections by       this implies adding   million
broadband connections each month from now onwards  According to an analysis
conducted by McKinsey  the Internet economy in India could grow to $   
billion by      to average     to     per cent of GDP  which could facilitate   
million jobs  if India follows an inclusive path of Internet expansion 
   Internet governance can be considered as the development and application of
shared principles  norms  rules  decision-making procedures  and programs that
shape the evolution and use of the Internet  It applies to activities as diverse as
the coordination of technical standards  the operation of critical infrastructure 
development  regulation  and legislation of Internet  There is a need to develop
a coherent strategy for Internet governance ensuring that difficult trade-offs
between competing interests  as well as between distinct public values  are
managed in a consistent  transparent and accountable manner that accurately
reflects internet users priorities 
   Multi-stakeholder or multi-lateral - two words encapsulating diametrically
opposite views on internet governance stands at the heart of a raging debate
across the globe  Multi-stakeholder control over the world wide web means
parties other than governments  which include the tech community  academia 
businesses and civil society  In a multi-lateral arrangement  only the
governments will be the decision-makers and every other stakeholder barring
the state  is relegated to a purely advisory role  Simply put  the choice is
between total state control over the internet or a more democratic set-up where
other sections of society are also represented 
   Civil society and businesses are concerned that being relegated to an advisory
role rather than a decision-making one could lead to disregarding or relegating
their positions to a secondary level  Also with the internet being enhanced
largely by private investment and individual demand it is important to safeguard
their interests to enable sustained investment interest by potential investors
who will enable the enhancement in networks providing access and services on
the internet 
   The internet architecture has traditionally been controlled by the US  The
demand for a more democratised set-up  where other countries also have a
voice  started in early     s  In       a consensus document  Tunis Agenda  had
been signed under the aegis of the UN  It laid out much of the terms of the
debate around internet governance  including the focus on enhanced
cooperation and the need for a multi-stakeholder model 
   The internet architecture has had a significant bering on the leadership of the US
in this regard  The demand for a more democratised set-up  where other
countries also have a voice  started in early     s  In       a consensus
document  Tunis Agenda  had been signed under the aegis of the UN  It laid out
much of the terms of the debate around internet governance  including the
focus on enhanced cooperation and the need for a multi-stakeholder model 
   In       India put forward a detailed proposal for a multi-lateral UN body that
was widely criticised by activists and business bodies at home  In Geneva 
Government of India's response to a question on implementing "enhanced
cooperation" in a WGEC questionnaire stated  "A suitable multilateral 
transparent and democratic mechanism must be created where governments 
on an equal footing  may carry out their roles and responsibilities in international
public policy issues pertaining to the Internet and public policy issues pertaining
to coordination and management of critical Internet resources  in consultation
with all other stakeholders " This position has been crticised by cvil society and
businesses 
    A critical factor in the success of the Internet has been the multi-stakeholder
framework and open access  In recent days  however  there is a growing
concern about the excessive influence of one country over some of the internet
governance mechanisms  Governments are coming to terms with their new role
in the internet and social media space  The Tunis Agenda      recognizes a role
for multi-stakeholders such as government  businesses  civil society  technical
community  academia and media 
    Several meetings are expected to be held in      including WSIS+   Review
(February)  UN CSTD Working Group on Enhanced Cooperation (February)  the
Brazil conference  The Global Multistakeholder Meeting on the Future of
Internet Governance  (April)  ICANN High Level Meeting (June)  UN Internet
Governance Forum  Istanbul  Turkey (September) and ITU Plenipot in Busan 
South Korea (October – November)  Much of the discussion in these meetings is
about initiating dialogue on core internet values and principles that must govern
the internet at a national and global level 
B  Internet Governance Principles
    COAI  which represents the largest industry association and serves nearly    
million mobile subscribers  provides the platform for the single largest access to
internet and social media platforms  using wireless devices  smart phones and
other related technologies  Our members who are primarily responsible for
access  and also participate in a range of issues which comprise the "internet
governance" space  including Access and Diversity  Multilingualism  New
Technologies such as IPv   Cyber and Telecom Network Security and several
Emerging Issues  A draft of some of the basic principles is provided below 
a) Recognize and develop a multi-stakeholder approach to policy development 
Internet governance efforts cannot be limited to global governments  the
Internet is a system that has thrived on the cooperation of a diversity of
stakeholders including the industry  civil society  and the technical community 
Therefore  an Internet governance policy has to be formed through an open 
transparent and inclusive process 
b) Support and promote an open and connected Internet  The Internet has
flourished in an open and free environment through a successful combination of
user empowerment  consensus driven voluntary codes and free market
dynamics  It must be recognized that the real value of the Internet comes from
the fact that it empowers the individual to access and share information across
borders and if barriers are introduced that interfere with this openness and
connectivity  the real value of the Internet will be diminished  Therefore  any
policy framework for the Internet must support openness and connectivity 
c) Promote investment in critical infrastructure  Deployment of high-speed
broadband Internet networks is essential for promoting access  driving economic
growth and creating jobs in India  India must invest in developing the required
broadband infrastructure on a national scale public policy should provide
appropriate incentives to the private sector to provide last mile connectivity to
the end users  especially in rural areas 
d) Promote and protect the free flow of information  The Internet s openness has
played a central role in empowering individual s to access and disseminate
information globally  While the Govt  must work towards addressing concerns
relating to protection of personal data  safety of children and cyber security 
fundamental freedoms of speech and privacy should not be curtailed under the
garb of security  The government must adopt a principles based approach to
surveillance especially ensuring an independent judicial oversight mechanism for
all surveillance activities 
e) Promote creation of multilingual content  There is a dearth of multilingual
content and public policy should provide incentives for entrepreneurs and app
developers for the creation and dissemination of content in all major Indian
languages  This will empower people from all states in India to access
information  goods and services of their choice 
f) Limit intermediary liability  Intermediary laws in India need to be reviewed so
that hampering of free speech on the Internet by encouraging private censorship
of content and hindering innovation and investment by imposing burdensome
compliances on intermediaries conducting business in India is taken care of 
Laws imposing appropriate limitations on intermediary liability particularly in
relation to third party content should be fair and reasonable and provide for
expression of free speech within constitutionally permissible limits and allow
intermediaries to provide services without undue harassment so that the
Internet remains a level playing field that rewards innovation and
entrepreneurship 
C  Roadmap for the Further Evolution of the Internet Governance Ecosystem
    The policies that shape the Internet impact not only the development of the
technologies themselves  but also the realization of internationally agreed
human rights  social equity and interdependence  cultural concerns  and both
social and economic development  Our vision is that Internet governance should
be inclusive  people centered and development oriented  Any policy framework
for the Internet must support openness and connectivity 
    The avialbility of affordable broadband connectivity to support internet services
must make a feasible business case for the private sector which is expected to
invest most significantly in laying down the networks and infrastructure support 
    Internet governance efforts should encompass all necessary stakeholders in a
manner that ensures that views of all stakeholders including the Govt  are
considered on an equal footing  and all stakeholders have a role in the decisionmaking 
    The government must adopt a principles based approach to surveillance
especially ensuring an independent judicial oversight mechanism for all
surveillance activities  Futher  vernacular support should be encouraged to
increase the proliferation of Internet services 

Princípios de Governança da Internet

Dentro do espírito que vem marcando a evolução da Internet no Brasil  balizado pelos Princípios da Governança e Uso da Internet no Brasil enunciados pelo CGI  Comitê Gestor da Internet  a BRASSCOM traz à discussão desta conferência os seguintes princípios 

( )  O atual debate sobre segurança da informação e privacidade de dados é importante e essencial para a garantia do Estado democrático e para o bom equilíbrio das relações entre as nações  Dessa forma  é de suma importância garantir a inviolabilidade dos dados dos cidadãos  bem como das empresas e das nações 

 

( )  O respeito integral aos princípios constitucionais que preveem o direito à inviolabilidade do sigilo da correspondência  das comunicações de dados e da privacidade do cidadão  salvo nas hipóteses previstas em lei e sob determinação judicial 

 

( )  A preservação da livre circulação da informação através da rede mundial 

 

( )  A garantia de acesso à toda informação disponível através da rede  desde que não seja eivada por conteúdo de natureza ilícita 

 

( )  A garantia do direito à livre contratação de serviços oferecidos através da rede mundial 

Tais princípios serão assegurados com o emprego de instrumentos jurídicos adequados  podendo incluir acordos internacionais bilaterais e multilaterais  e soluções tecnológicas robustas em matéria de segurança da rede  arquitetura de sistemas  medidas e mecanismos de segurança da informação e gestão eficientes 

Evolução futura da governança do ecossistema da Internet

É da natureza da Internet o estímulo à inovação e ao desenvolvimento econômico e social de comunidades e países  A rede mundial é a grande responsável pelo surgimento da Economia Digital  integrando infraestrutura de telecomunicações  tecnologia da informação  atividades socioeconômicas  mídias sociais e computação em nuvem  Em especial  o advento desta tecnologia trouxe uma nova realidade  tornou mais eficiente a maneira de armazenar dados e permitiu reduções significativas de gastos com servidores  manutenção de equipamentos  licenças  energia elétrica e infraestrutura interna 

É importante lembrar que o Brasil é um fornecedor global de serviços de TI e que o país pode desempenhar  nesta área  um papel estratégico na economia global  situando-se como um dos cinco principais centros de excelência tecnológica do mundo 

 

O que melhor pode garantir o pleno desempenho deste potencial é que a evolução da governança da Internet ocorra por meio de um modelo de governança participativa que conte com o envolvimento de todos os atores relevantes e interessados nas esferas governamentais  empresariais e de representação da sociedade civil  entre outros  e que leve ao fortalecimento de organismos globais independentes  transparentes  representativos e democráticos  capazes de produzir soluções negociadas que contemplem a diversidade de opiniões de seus participantes 

Submission to the Global Multistakeholder Meeting on the Future of Internet Governance

 

 

 th March     

 

 

 

Section    Internet Governance Principles

 

 

 

The Computer & Communications Industry Association (CCIA) welcomes the opportunity to participate in the Global Multistakeholder Meeting on the Future of Internet Governance ( the Meeting )  CCIA represents a broad cross-section of the world s leading technology companies that collectively employ hundreds of thousands of people and generating hundreds of billions of dollars in annual turnover  contributing to the economies of the majority of the world s countries and territories and in all its regions  Like the rest of the economy  our member companies rely on an open  stable  secure  resilient  and interoperable Internet   We believe that a healthy  vibrant  stable  effective  and pluralistic Internet governance system is essential  and that all stakeholders with a role in developing  maintaining  or using the Internet must be able to participate in  and impact  decisions that would impact them or it 

 

Four Principles to Create a Common Understanding of What Is  and Is Not  Internet Governance-Related

 

In order to have a healthy and effective Internet Governance ecosystem  it is first necessary to have agreement on what is  and what is not  within the scope of that term  Despite the adoption of a definition of Internet Governance almost    years ago[ ]  disagreement on its meaning continues to this day 

 

We propose four principles we believe the Global Stakeholder Meeting on the Future of Internet Governance should endorse to create a common understanding of what aspects of policy should properly be considered as Internet governance related  principles we believe are not in conflict with the Tunis Agenda definition 

 

First Principle  The network and the data that network carries are in fact (and are to be treated as) entirely separate at the policy level

 

 

The  network of networks  that is the Internet is made possible by a set of systems and services that interoperate to make it possible for any point  a  to connect to any point  b  anywhere in the world  These systems and services operate separately from the data that is communicated once the connection between points is made  It consists of  unique identifiers like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses and Domain Names  submarine  overland cable  satellite and mobile links  Internet exchange points (IXP)  and software and hardware based security infrastructure implementing common standards (such as DNSSec) to ensure the point  b  you reach is the authentic  point b  

 

 

Second Principle  No stakeholder may take measures that compromise the ability of the network to connect the greatest number of users at the lowest cost and as efficiently as possible 

 

We note that a subset of this is that countries must not take measures with respect to the network infrastructure located on territory under their control that would impact neighbouring or other countries to which that infrastructure directly connects - just as countries are constrained  for example  from disruption to riverine systems that pass through multiple countries other than their own 

 

 

Third Principle  The management of  and access to  data that traverses the network is not a subject of international Internet Governance 

 

 

The understanding of what constitutes private information  criminal behaviour  libel  fraud  and many other aspects of communications are the remit of national law  defining these terms is an essential element of national sovereignty  Where international law addresses issues to create global norms or processes  those fora are best suited to discuss and reach agreement on measures for the digital environment as regards data in that domain  In other words  what takes place online is no different than what takes place in the physical world  Both spheres tackle the same challenges and the existing mechanisms for dealing with those challenges should be utilized rather than create a separate set of organizations or rules that only apply to the Internet  For example  with respect to human rights  the Human Rights Council and the instruments to which it relates address the online and offline aspects of that area of law  With respect to the economic use of data  there are international arrangements and processes in world trade law such as the WTO  UNCTAD  and OECD (for all  developing  and developed countries respectively) whereby commercial rules between countries as well as bilateral arrangements are dealt with 

 

 

Fourth Principle  Regulating the Internet  or technology more generally  will not solve social problems 

 

 

The surveillance activities revealed over the last several months that are the subject of concern are spawning proposals in various countries  such as obliging commercial operators to host certain kinds of data in given geographic locations  This will have unintended negative side effects without changing the relative security of that data  and without solving the underlying issue related to the lack of cooperative arrangements between countries to ensure governments can ensure the security of their citizens   Such a discussion is fundamentally not about the Internet or Internet Governance but rather how all stakeholders can cooperate regarding serious security threats 

 

 

A general agreement on the above four principles would bring a great deal of clarity as to what is  and is not  the proper remit for activities related to Internet Governance and where subjects with an  Internet dimension  that are not Internet Governance related should be discussed  It would also make designing and delimiting Internet Governance activities more sustainable  likely to result in discussions with maximum utility  and ensure outcomes with the least likelihood of unintended negative consequences 

 

 

Global Internet Governance principles

 

As noted above  there already exists a fulsome list of global principles that apply to the Internet  The compilation of Internet Governance principles on the NetMundial website is quite exhaustive and reflects a broad international consensus  In particular  we draw attention to the Internet Governance Principles by the Council of Europe  the EU Commission COMPACT  the Principles for the Governance and Use of the Internet by CGI br  the OECD Principles for Internet Decision-Making  the Global Network Initiative Principles  and the APC Code of Practice on Internet Governance  which all offer very balanced and sensible guidelines 

 

 

We believe that NetMundial could serve a very valuable purpose by seeking to distil those principles into a set generally agreeable across all stakeholder groups  From our perspective  the following principles seem of particular value to define what Internet Governance processes should embody 

 

?      Inclusiveness and diversity

 

?      Transparency and accountability

 

?      Access

 

?      Universality

 

?      Interoperability and Standardisation

 

?      Security  stability  and decentralization of the network

 

?      Openness and neutrality of the network

 

 

With respect to multi stakeholder participation  we suggest there is a need to adopt a set of minimum standards for the quality and nature of such participation  and that this should be based upon existing understandings such as the Aarhus Convention s commitments on public participation and the process of broadening that understanding beyond the Convention s remit [ ] The International Association for Public Participation (IAP ) has also done excellent work in this vein  its Core Principles are widely used[ ] 

 

 

 

Section    Roadmap for the Further Evolution of the Internet Governance Ecosystem

 

 

Introduction

 

To create a road map for Internet Governance going forward  a common understanding on what is  and is not  within scope is necessary  taking the four principles above as a foundation  we have proposals below on how to improve Internet Governance arrangements 

 

 

However  the question of how Internet Governance arrangements intersect and interact with other public policy issues that have a strong  Internet dimension  is equally important  This was anticipated    years ago in the Tunis Agenda s Article   (a) 

 

 Policy authority for Internet-related public policy issues is the sovereign right of States  They have rights and responsibilities for international Internet-related public policy issues  

 

 

Like the definition of Internet Governance itself  this paragraph has also been subject to disputed interpretation  We suggest some ideas for how Internet Governance processes can better relate to these policy areas  when appropriate  below 

 

 

Roadmap for Core Internet Governance Issues

 

If you accept the four principles developed in section    it becomes much simpler to identify core Internet Governance issues 

 

 

Internet protocols and other technical standards have rapidly evolved through a set of diverse organizations  each with different core functions and strengths  In our view  and as other submissions have pointed out  stakeholders should continue to rely on the existing structures to develop global policies and seek to improve them where necessary rather than relying on either existing multilateral arrangements or starting over and creating a new governance body with a duplicative function 

 

 

Existing Internet Governance arrangements include institutions like the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF)  the World Wide Web Consortium (W C) and the Internet Architecture Board (IAB) for global standards and protocols  the Internet Corporation for the Assignment of Names and Numbers (ICANN) and Regional Internet Registries (RIRs) for the coordination of unique identifiers  and the UN s Internet Governance Forum (IGF)  which brings together all stakeholders including academia  governments  civil society  and industry to foster discussion or critical Internet issues 

 

 

What these arrangements share is an understanding that all stakeholders who have a role in developing  maintaining  or use of the Internet must be able to participate in  and impact  decisions that would impact them or it  There are many perspectives on multi-stakeholder-ism and what it means  The reality is that the Internet of today is a web of collaboration  built upon open standards  involving all the parties necessary to ensure the Internet and the data it carries operates today and evolves for tomorrow 

 

 

Here are just a few ideas for how existing organisations could be improved 

 

 

?  Increased outreach  capacity building and training for regulators   While many if not all of the technical meetings are open to all participants  the majority of the meetings historically have taken place in the developed world and their processes can be difficult to grasp as a newcomer   We applaud recent efforts undertaken by the IETF and ISOC to increase the global reach of their meetings as well as offer fellowships to engineers and policymakers from the developing world   We would support similar efforts in this space in other fora as these present important opportunities to engage thought leaders globally 

 

?  Increase and diversify newcomer sessions   International organizations should make it easier for newer participants to meaningfully engage in their processes   To do this  these organizations should offer training and newcomer sessions both at their physical meetings and remotely as a means of introducing more people to the organizations and encouraging them to participate in critical Internet governance debates 

 

?    Improve transparency and accountability   Multilateral organizations whose missions touch the Internet (e g   UNESCO  OECD  UN  and ITU) should provide better transparency and accountability in their decision-making processes and how the overall decisions impact the Internet   All institutions should strive to make relevant governance and policy documents available to all stakeholders at no cost - and easy to find  

 

?     Open  accessible meetings  Participation in board and governance meetings of Internet governance organizations should be open whenever possible   For many participants  it is difficult and often cost-prohibitive to attend meetings in person   For that reason  Internet governance institutions should improve remote participation logistics and opportunities 

 

?  Improve accessibility of institutions and reduce barriers to entry  The assortment of organizations and overlapping missions can be confusing and difficult to navigate without considerable time and effort  All institutions should collaborate to create portals online where their interrelationships and the scope of their activities is easy for new entrants to understand 

 

?   Institutions should consider collaborating to organize physical meetings of more than one organisation in the same city and closely enough in time that participants could attend them all  this would reduce travel costs and time 

 

?  All organisations with a global mandate have an obligation to ensure multilingual documents and interpretation in multiple languages is available for key documents and meetings respectively 

 

 

Policy Areas With an Internet Dimension But Outside of Internet Governance

 

 

What about issues that are not covered by these policy fora? We submit that they fall into two categories or types 

 

 

    Issues where international norms exist  but where a networked world has created challenges in implementation of these norms 

 

     Issues where no norms exist but where conflicts in national laws have arisen primarily because of a networked world 

 

 

Both fall squarely within the Fourth Principle s ambit  they are social issues with an online component but they are not Internet issues – and therefore entirely outside Internet Governance  Here are examples of each 

 

 

Type  

 

Human and Political Rights  The various human rights treaties are the responsibility of the UN s Human Rights Council (HRC) and some of the provisions are considered jus cogens - globally binding on all States  The HRC has decided that existing human rights apply fully in the online environment  However  many states are facing difficult questions  how does the right of free speech apply within their states when non-nationals may post information to non-locally-based  yet locally-used  popular websites that infringe local laws or social mores 

 

 

Type   

 

The treatment of personally identifying information (PII) falls into two categories 

 

       Its use by non-state actors  and 

 

       Its use by state actors 

 

 

In neither case are there international norms specifically addressing the use of PII[ ]  This is because in an analogue past  physical data related to people simply didn t travel across borders routinely in large amounts related to entire populations  yet on the Internet this happens daily and routinely  It must be emphasised that these two categories are entirely different in almost every respect and need to be dealt with separately for a multitude of reasons  just the most stark example being that use by non-state actors generally involves consent by the user  and use by state actors not only is often non-consensual but is often not even known of by the user 

 

 

Roadmap for Policy Areas With an Internet Dimension

 

For issues of  Type    there s a need for the  Internet dimension  to be fully a part of the deliberations of those processes mandated to address them  Creating additional processes that are  Internet-centric  to address them would be a mistake 

 

 

     The subject matter is not fundamentally Internet related and so shouldn t  belong  to Internet policy 

 

    The subject matter expertise is centred in the existing process and decisions made without that context and expertise are unlikely to be as well-informed as they should 

 

 

Existing fora need to accept that the Internet dimension to  their  issue must engage all stakeholders in developing solutions that they will either need to live with or help implement   This requires a truly multi-stakeholder process to bring the Internet community into collaboration with existing processes that are not inherently multi stakeholder (such as the UN s HRC)  Such processes should be based on existing best practices and norms as previously mentioned 

 

 

With respect to Type    the challenge is more complex  First agreement that an international discussion on the subject is needed  and further agreement on what aspects of which of the two subtypes mentioned above should be discussed and in what context  For example  the treatment of non-nationals by national security mechanisms are greatly complicated because the Internet allows the gathering of information globally at a low marginal cost and almost instantly yet the only norms that are not contested by states to limit their behaviour are bilateral agreements such as Mutual Legal Assistance Treaties (MLATs)[ ]  most of which predate the Internet s widespread adoption 

 

 

How Can Internet Governance Policy Interact with Issues that Impact the Internet  Yet Are Outside the Scope of Internet Governance?

 

In many ways  the Global Multistakeholder Meeting on the Future of Internet Governance is an attempt to answer the question immediately above  without the surveillance disclosures of the last several months  the Meeting would not have been proposed or convened  A dynamic has been created where governments feel action must be taken to protect their citizens  data from foreign surveillance agencies  One avenue they re clearly pursuing is to look at Internet Governance arrangements due to the historical accident that has provided a unique role to the US government with respect to certain technical functions 

 

 

A major success for the Meeting would be to create a consensus around the ideas we espouse in the Fourth Principle and then through proposing practical measures that can meet the gap in the current landscape 

 

 

One of the most straightforward is through improvements to the Internet Governance Forum system (the international IGF and the regional and national versions)  All stakeholders are represented in these meetings  yet the discussions too often do not have conclusions  where they do  there is no mechanism by which those conclusions can be taken further  We suggest the following 

 

?   The IGF should continue to be an informal  dialogue-centred process  but that dialogue should prioritize the activities that fall into two main areas  rather than continuing to simply host workshops in various subject areas as has been the case thus far 

 

a   Look at the various areas outside Internet Governance where a profound impact on the Internet  or where Internet Governance could have a profound impact  is likely and the venues where those areas are being discussed and create opportunities for the IG community and those other communities to interact  The IGF should also seek to identify issues with an Internet dimension that are not currently being addressed elsewhere and consider how a conversation could be structured as a starting point  if there s general consensus that such a conversation is needed 

 

b    Create space whereby the national and regional IGF conclusions are visible and discussed at the international IGF  and vice-versa  to allow better sharing between these IGFs of good ideas  concerns  and activities 

 

?     The IGF Secretariat should be greatly strengthened and mandated to create interagency links between existing fora where the Internet dimension is identified by the IGF as significant  it should also be able to propose processes that need attention to the IGF  It should also have the capacity to track and interact with discussions with an Internet dimension taking place in other agencies or processes and create dialogue between it  the IGF  and those others 

 

 

Conclusion

 

In order to develop a common understanding of  and a road map for the future development of the global Internet policy landscape  it is fundamental to establish a clear distinction between core Internet Governance issues and the wider set of issues with an Internet dimension 

 

 

While it is important to make existing Internet Governance arrangements more diverse and accessible  the key question is how they are to interact with other policy areas outside of Internet Governance  but with an Internet dimension  This includes both areas where international norms exist  i e  through Human Rights obligations  and areas that are fundamentally governed by national laws and where no international norms exist  i e  the use of PII information 

 

 

Instead of creating additional   Internet-specific   processes to address areas where the subject matter is not fundamentally Internet related and the expertise is  therefore  centred in other  existing processes  existing fora need to embrace the Internet dimension of their issues and start to engage with the Internet community  With regards to the latter  the situation is more challenging  Before effective international coordination can take place  agreement on the need for norms need to be reached - or at least the need for an international  conversation  

 

 

The IGF should play a key role  It can facilitate the coordination between existing institutions and the Internet community and it can help identify new areas where international norms are needed  However  the IGF and its Secretariat would need to be strengthened to assume these additional responsibilities 

 

 

We thank the organisers of the Meeting for this opportunity to submit our views and look forward to the next steps and to the meeting itself

Section    Internet Governance Principles 

 

As key participants in the Internet ecosystem  we have been closely following the recent developments surrounding Internet Governance   In our view  baseline discussion of Internet Governance Principles must include the following 

 

       Unwavering commitment to a true multistakeholder bottom-up approach  which includes the institutions that have successfully fostered the development of the Internet to what it is today  

 

       Governance principles that expect accommodate and encourage the evolution of technology and other forms of innovation  Evolution and change are the hallmarks of the Internet and its uses  The Internet in a few years time will differ markedly from what it is now  Its users have demonstrated remarkable resiliency in adapting to and fostering change  Technology  left to the private sector with appropriate governmental incentives  has demonstrated the ability to accommodate rapid change and growth 

 

       Promotion and protection of the stability  security  interoperability  and resiliency of the Internet  Governments and the private sector should incentivize development of protocols and standards by appropriate standards and technical bodies to meet the needs of those expecting a secure  stable  resilient Internet 

 

       Promotion of standard setting  regulatory  and legal environments across jurisdictional lines that support innovation  prevent malfeasance  and avoids unnecessary duplication or political interference 

 

       Promotion  through incentives and lightweight regulatory schemes  of investment and development of high speed networks and cross border delivery of services 

 

We also appreciate the openness shown by the meeting organizers in soliciting these inputs and are hopeful that the final synthesis will occur in a multistakeholder and transparent manner to ensure all perspectives are accurately and appropriately reflected  

 

 

 

Section    Roadmap for the Further Evolution of the Internet Governance Ecosystem 

 

A detailed Road Map can be developed once agreed upon principles are developed  With only two days of consultation available during the meeting we believe that this meeting should seek to initiate discussions and debates as opposed to deliver outcomes or conclusions  

 

A general Roadmap follows a typical methodology  Once an agreed set of Internet Governance principles are developed  stakeholders in appropriate fora can 

 

·       develop sets of objectives against each of the principles 

 

·       measure the gap between the status quo and each of these objectives 

 

·       form an issues statement identifying and describing the gaps or difference as the issues to be addressed 

 

·       examine the available fora or Internet Governance bodies that develop policy or technical outcomes involved in these issues  and then

 

·       test outcomes and develop implementation plans carefully to achieve broad multi-stakeholder consensus 

 

As supporters of the multistakeholder model that has operated in a way to bring the current vibrant Internet into being  we think that change should only be enacted through careful  thoughtful processes 

 

For example  as an active participant in the  Net discussion forums  we have seen significant attention directed to the future of the IANA function   This has been a vibrant discussion but the possible intended and unintended effects resulting from specific changes are too complex to be developed without considerable analysis and test   Possible changes to the IANA function should be discussed after identification of the issues statement and the gap between its current operation and our principles 

 

Therefore  we believe that at this time it would be premature to try and reach conclusions on issues such as this and others  As such we encourage organizers and participants in NETmundial to focus on high level principles that will help frame on-going discussions at upcoming meetings such as the      Internet Governance Forum  WSIS Review  High Level London Meeting and the ITU Plenipotentiary   In addition to the anticipated NETmundial session  we view the current set of Internet Governance Fora (http //www intgovforum org/cms/) to be an effective and available methodology for carrying discussion forward and developing principles 

 

Once again thank you for the opportunity to contribute and we look forward to bringing the perspectives of the Domain Name Association the NETmundial in Sao Paulo 

Data Security Council of India (DSCI) proposes a roadmap for further evolution of the Internet Governance model to ensure a single interoperable Internet  Steps are 

    A multi stakeholder model with defined roles of relevant stakeholders on all matters needs to be evolved  The conference  should ensure participation that is proportional to Internet population  Topics and issues  be it policy  technical or administrative  where representation of a set of stakeholders is mere ceremonial and not participatory  should not act as bottleneck in effective decision making 
    Global governance norms be evolved that separate DNS maintenance from policies on TLDs  as well as public policies that intersect with nations  rights to make them 
    Industry s participation from developing countries in standards making be ensured by changes such as making IETF open without having to pay for seat in committees and the Board (as is the current practice) 
    For ICT sector to flourish  and contribute more to socio economic development  propositions such as localization of ICT within territorial boundaries of regions etc  should not be encouraged 
    Effective participation of stakeholders from developing and least developed economies should be encouraged and facilitated  with focus on capacity building 
    National governments role in law and order  content regulation and national security within their territories be accepted  else international clashes will continue 
    Countries should be asked to send nominees of all stakeholders  rather than ICANN directly selecting people without any transparency 
 

Given that all stakeholders (including all nation states) would not effectively be represented in the Netmundial meeting  and the committees that have been formed do not ensure adequate representation of right set of stakeholders  DSCI views it as a platform that can carry forward the dialogue on evolving Internet governance model that is currently underway at numerous platforms  Further  the outcome of the meeting can be used as platform to further propose solutions that can be considered by global community to evolve Internet Governance model 

We represent part of this multistakeholder model and we would like to express our gratitude for the opportunity to deliver our comments in preparation of the meeting 

Internet has evolved over the course of the last decades due to the development of technology  the information society and communication  As a result enhance and maintain knowledge  and accept the multistakeholder model level of government  civil society  business and academia this net continuous to grow

Internet Governance Principles

Internet has evolved over the course of the last decades due to the development of technology  the information society and communication  As a result enhance and maintain knowledge  and accept the multistakeholder model level of government  civil society  business and academia this net continuous to grow 

However with the development of the Internet  where it coexist public activity and private  the application of various principles is necessary  The principles that have different levels of management depending on the social and economic stage where countries are 

We believe that the principles of departure for the development of Internet should be already existing text  but we think that the following principles are those should deepen 

- The access to Internet  this principle includes the possibility to choose the software and the system  to warrant the digital inclusion  the neutrality and equality of the net 

- Freedom and equality in Internet  the persons have the right to be secure and trusted in the net  without ciberbullyng  grooming  identity theft  data protection  and others crimes  In addition to the crimes all the persons have the right to access a good services and protocols 

- Freedom of expression and information  this principle is basic to communication and evolves the persons through the net 

- Privacy of Internet  we need to develop this principle because this is a right that people have offline  and must also be protected online 

There are several principles that have been studied by large organizations such as the OECD  but we believe that these are to be further explored 

ABRANET - Contribution - Principles and Multistakeholder Governance for Internet

 

ABRANET - Brazilian Internet Association -  Principles and Multistakeholder Governance for Internet  Worldwide digital age values     Freedom  privacy and human rights     Democratic and collaborative governance     Universality     Diversity     Innovation     Neutrality of the Network     Unaccountability of the Network    Functionality  Security and Stability    Standardization and Interoperability      Legal and Regulatory Environment 

 

        Internet Principles

Abranet proposes the adoption of the principles listed below  which summarize the values ??selected by CGI br  multistakeholder governance body of the Internet in Brazil  for the continued development of civil liberties and the network  and that can contribute on a global level  not only to its continuing expansion  but also and especially for the realization of human rights in the digital age 

The defended adoption of such principles will still be a great achievement for the user s protection from any nationality against violations and abuses of law  an issue that has faced considerable difficulty in standardization around the world because of political interferences 

The principles  for establishing core values  establish a state to be sought  and will provide guidance to the rules issued by countries as well as the rules established by each user in their own environment  Selected such values??  it will be possible  in the end  spread their protection effectively at a national level  adopting them as stony values ??the user and the network  turning them into universal legal right to be safeguarded at all different scales of network 

 

   Freedom  privacy and human rights The use of the Internet must be driven by the principles of freedom of expression  individual privacy and the respect for human rights  recognizing them as essential to the preservation of a fair and democratic society     Democratic and collaborative governance Internet governance must be exercised in a transparent  multilateral and democratic manner  with the participation of the various sectors of society  thereby preserving and encouraging its character as a collective creation      Universality Internet access must be universal so that it becomes a tool for human and social development  thereby contributing to the formation of an inclusive and nondiscriminatory society  for the benefit of all      Diversity Cultural diversity must be respected and preserved and its expression must be stimulated  without the imposition of beliefs  customs or values      Innovation Internet governance must promote the continuous development and widespread dissemination of new technologies and models for access and use      Neutrality of the network Filtering or traffic privileges must meet ethical and technical criteria only  excluding any political  commercial  religious and cultural factors or any other form of discrimination or preferential treatment      Unaccountability of the network All action taken against illicit activity on the network must be aimed at those directly responsible for such activities  and not at the means of access and transport  always upholding the fundamental principles of freedom  privacy and the respect for human rights      Functionality  security and stability The stability  security and overall functionality of the network must be actively preserved through the adoption of technical measures that are consistent with international standards and encourage the adoption of best practices      Standardization and interoperability The Internet must be based on open standards that facilitate interoperability and enable all to participate in its development       Legal and regulatory environments

The legal and regulatory environments must preserve the dynamics of the Internet as a space for collaboration [ ]

        Internet Governance Model

Abranet argues that Internet Governance follows "multistakeholder" model adopted by CGI BR – Comitê Gestor da Internet no Brasil  Abranet understands that in order to achieve the desired effects with such a model  it is elementary that the government involvement in the governance framework is minority  increasing the participation of society organizations (academia  technical  private sector and civil society) in the taken decisions 

 

 Multistakeholder processes could and should enhance democracy by increasing opportunities for effective participation by those most directly impacted by decisions and particularly those at the grassroots who so often are voiceless in these processes  It should enhance democracy by ensuring that decisions made are reflective of and responsive to local concerns and to the broadest range of those who must bear the consequences  It should enhance democracy by making democratic processes more flexible and responsive  able to adjust to changing contexts circumstances  technologies  impacted populations   [ ]

Abstract 

Sinditelebrasil is the representative entity of all Personal Mobile Service Providers and Fixed Telephony Service Providers and Multimedia Communication Service Providers in Brazil  We appreciate the opportunity to participate in the Global Multi-stakeholder Meeting on the Future of Internet Governance and we would like to congratulate the Government of Brazil for this good effort to invite governments and the global Internet community to discuss the existing model of Internet Governance and its evolution 

 

Our representatives are the major Internet Service Providers – ISP´s in Brazil  They are   active stakeholders in the Internet Governance debate and they want to express their interest in to bring contributions and help to build a solid base for the discussions at NETmundial and to help bridging the divergent views to make the conference a success on the way to a more inclusive and better Internet Governance 

 

   Internet Governance Principles

 

The electronic communications industry has made possible the unparalleled expansion of Internet connections and penetration worldwide  A very significant proportion of total broadband and other Internet connections are made using mobile networks  and that growth – nurtured and stimulated by competition – is accelerating   Today  Internet users are mainly from emerging economies and this should also be reflected in the way the Internet is governed  To maintain this pace and give access to those still unconnected  providing them with education  vital medical and governmental services  and unprecedented opportunities for new job creation and economic growth  it is crucial that Internet policy encourages telecommunications operators to continue to invest and give them the freedom to provide innovative new networks and services 

 

Competition and a light touch regulatory environment are needed to innovate in access and connectivity through private sector investment and the roll-out of network infrastructure worldwide  For this to continue  the broadband and Internet ecosystems need stable and predictable regulatory regimes  based on a level-playing field for all actors and free from uncertainty at national and international levels  Today  the level and intensity of regulation differs considerably between various agents of the Internet value chain  Going forward  the sustainability of the Internet will also depend on finding a level-playing field for all actors across the Internet value chain 

 

    We recognize the efforts made during the last years to define a common set of principles for the Internet  There are already many principle documents agreed by various international fora and institutions (OECD  G   European Commission) regarding the Internet  NETmundial should built on these  but focus on finding principles for the Governance of the Internet (in contrast to  General Internet Principles)  but obviously such principles for the Governance of the Internet need to be aligned with the more general Internet Principles 

 

    The outcome would be a global set of Internet Governance Principles  which could serve as a global reference point and a guiding light for all stakeholders about the Governance of the Internet 

 

    NETmundial should try to get agreements between all stakeholders on the key set of governance principles that have made the Internet a global success  Sinditelebrasil believes that this will be rather few than many principles and that they need to capture broad consensus between all stakeholders and involved parties 

 

    The Internet has become such a fantastic success because it was based on a governance structure that was open to all interested stakeholders  global in reach and guided by a cooperative spirit between all involved parties  This is a basis which is not found in any other area of international policy and governance and should be respected simply due to the fact that it was the basis of the growth of the Internet up to now and has overall worked considerably well 

 

    However  the amazing growth of the Internet is putting stress on this model of Internet Governance  While in      two-thirds of all Internet users were from the developed world  in      two-thirds will stem from emerging economies  This brings all challenges of international Public Policy to the Internet and makes it governance more challenging due to an increased diversity of views  morals and interests  NETmundial should therefore be an important step to evolve the Internet Governance model by building on its existing foundations and without endangering its growth  resilience and stability 

 

    Sinditelebrasil believes that finding such global consensus on Internet Governance would be crucial to restore trust and confidence of users and states in the Internet and create a basis for a sustainable growth of the Internet  Such growth is needed to get everyone connected to the Internet based on interconnected Internet infrastructures and networks   

 

    Sinditelebrasil therefore believes that NETmundial should consider the following key principles and outcomes for the Internet and its Governance 

 

( )    Promote an Internet which is economically sustainable  interconnected  secure  stable and resilient  able to build confidence for all its users globally and flexible enough to adapt to the fast-changing nature of the Internet 

 

( )    Protect Human Rights and fundamental principles like the rule of law for Internet users in the same way online as they are protected offline

 

( )    Commit to a collaborative  inclusive and open Internet Governance where no single stakeholder or group of stakeholder dominates but all stakeholders work together and can engage on equal footing and in accordance with their respective roles  this includes also governments in their recognized role as representatives of societies for the definition of Public Policy on national and international level 

 

( )    Acknowledge that the current government mechanisms for technical and operational matters of the Internet have proved to make it a remarkably stable and resilient system and that the technical community and private sector should retain their leading roles for the day-to-day management of a global  interconnected Internet    

 

( )    Ensure that Internet Governance processes are improved and defined to be fully transparent  inclusive and easily accessible  but also accountable for their decisions 

 

 

   A roadmap for the further evolution of the Internet Governance ecosystem

 

Sinditelebrasil supports that any roadmap for the evolution of the Internet Governance System should ensure that all affected parties are included in this process on equal footing  in their respective roles and in an open  transparent and accessible way  We congratulate NETmundial and the Brazilian government for their efforts to achieve this in the organization of the conference 

 

We also recognize that the existing governance mechanisms and organizations dealing with Internet Governance have worked considerably well and allowed the fantastic development of the Internet to a global  interconnected network of networks  This by itself gives these governance mechanism and institutions the legitimacy to be listened to and heard in the current debate  Institutions like the I-Stars (ICANN  IETF  ISOC etc ) and also platforms like the UN IGF have great merits for the development of the Internet as we know it 

 

Internet Governance has today developed to be a global governance model sui generis and is much more than any other governance mechanism based on collaboration between stakeholders  Especially private actors and technical entities lead and ensure the day-to-day management of its core functions and do the investments needed in infrastructure and services to create what is referred to as  The Internet    

 

Sinditelebrasil believes that the open nature of the multi-stakeholder process does not guarantee by itself an adequate participation among all stakeholders  Traditional governance models  which are based on top-down decision making processes and multilateral agreements between governments  usually agreed in lengthy negotiations  cannot be the most adequate for governing the fast-changing Internet with its global reach and private  interconnected networks 

 

This is what quite often happens in the decision process of some international institutions  Analogous considerations can be made regarding the transparency of the multi-stakeholder process  Quite often information overload characterizes meetings and fora of the multi-stakeholder process creating real difficulties to focus at important issues  A stronger effort is required by all parties to improve and make more successful this process 

 

We also acknowledge that due to the increasingly global and diverse user base of the Internet and its key role for the economic developments of all nations and states  Internet Governance processes need to better involve Public Policy concerns from governments and states and need to evolve accordingly 

 

Sinditelebrasil supports that NETmundial should set out the areas where an evolution of Internet Governance is deemed necessary and where there is the most urgent need to evolve the currently existing governance mechanism  Once these areas are defined  a roadmap to address such changes should be agreed 

 

This approach should be seen as an evolution from the current governance model  The current multi-stakeholder model must evolved to one that makes a appropriated distinction between two concepts  shared and equal responsibility   While all stakeholders need to participate in the multi-stakeholder model on equal footing  the decision process must take into account the different responsibilities of the each Internet agent directly involved in a particular issue  In this way  the nature of the governance issue must take into consideration 

 

We emphasize that this new governance model needs to distinguish carefully different areas and issues of Internet Governance as not all have the same impact on Public Policy  At the same time  not all issues need the same involvement and same set of stakeholders  institutions and parties to define solutions  Just to give an example setting standards and agree technical protocols for the Internet has worked considerably well under the existing governance mechanisms which are lead by private companies and entities  However  how to protect privacy and security of Internet users on a global level is a much more difficult and controversial issue and has a much higher impact on Public Policy and clearly need to involve governments in a leading role    

 

At the same time the example of Online Privacy also shows that it might also be necessary to distinguish between global and local (or regional) levels  and to use the concept of subsidiarity to decide on what level decisions need to be taken  because many national states protect already privacy online  but there is no global agreement and protection  mainly regarding sovereign rights of other countries  In general the principle of subsidiarity could be considered to determine which issues need to be solved at global level and which one can be dealt with by stakeholders at local levels 

 

Governments are the representatives of the people and therefore are an important source of democratic legitimation regarding Public Policy issues affecting the Internet  They should ensure the existence of open  inclusive and transparent mechanisms for Internet Governance  respect Human Rights and the rule of law  and guarantee the right policy frameworks for competitive digital markets with fair rules for all players (level-playing-field) which are necessary to safeguard increased investments and innovation across all layers of the commercial Internet Ecosystem  They should also engage in relevant processes of Internet Governance and policymaking  especially when and where there is a relevant impact on Public Policy  e g  in issues like online privacy and cyber-security  In such areas solutions without leading involvement of governments  engaging with other stakeholder like the technical community  private sector  civil society and academia  will not be possible to achieve 

 

The IGF has played a very important role in bringing together stakeholders   It should be studied if it could have more concrete mechanisms and its policy outcomes should be integrated into other  existing governance mechanisms  The IGF should be better funded and its role and influence expanded  The interactions between the global IGF and the national and regional IGFs should also be strengthened 

 

Finally  due to the completely changed nature of today´s Internet  with its global usage and with most users in the emerging world  also the key Internet resources  especially the IANA function  need to be globalized  The appropriate process and ways to achieve that goal as soon as possible from a legal and technical point of view and without endangering the stability of the Internet should be defined by NETmundial as well

Context

 

Our lives have significantly changed in the past decades and  if we can relate the catalyzing event of all that change  it certainly is the advent of the Internet and the diffusion of the information technology  We might not be able to actually measure the impact of the information technology in our daily lives yet – not now  while we are sunk in it 

 

We cannot  however  forget that the information technology is not an end on its own  but instead  it is a way  A way for the development of the society  so that the human beings can reach their maximum potential  It is a way for the society to reassure the values of democracy and preserving of individual rights 

 

The Internet is the main result of the evolution of information technology  It is a conquest from the plural society  It is the organized global society  source of information  inspiration and consequent evolution from the oral tradition  It is also a source of explicit knowledge for the creation of the true global and has become a primary foundation for the creation and affirmation of the individual and the society 

 

Something with such characteristics cannot belong to anyone  neither can be controlled or monitored to meet the motivations of a group  whichever those motivations may be  The nature of the internet and the base of its conception is to be free and even anarchic - term that suggests an environment not subordinated to the State or any other form of power  making the monopoly by force inapplicable   

 

The internet is the network of the networks  interconnecting commercial  academic  governmental and domestic networks  When the American Department for Defense  through its agency DARPA  idealized an alternative for the delivering of information  considering the possibility having communication knots eventually affected by enemy missiles  it was actually conceiving a communication network that was independent and able to operate without direct control of anyone  This is the real spirit of the internet 

 

Introduction

 

In June       the surprising revelations of the at the time NSA technician Edward Snowden showed the world that the national sovereignty and the individual freedom were at risk  The debate about the role of the internet in the relationship between people  companies and the government is a highly relevant topic considering the abuse that has been committed by governments that feel themselves owners  if not of the whole internet  at least of part of it 

 

The first thing that needs to be clear for the understanding of the position of the institutions that deal with cybernetic defense and security is that their guidelines should be oriented by the main role of both defense and security  protecting the information society  a society that has massively migrated from the physical to the digital and connected world  The role of the Defense and all agents who work to make sure the laws are being respected is to make the internet a safe place 

 

When the perspective of security and defense are being debated  two are the main points that cause higher inflection  (i) about the impact of the anonymity for the internet as it is now and (ii) about the capacity of a country of being affected by a direct intervention (attack) and/or an existent cybernetic dependence 

 

 

ABOUT THE PERSPECTIVE OF THE CYBERNETIC CRIMES AND ANONYMNITY

 

The cybernetic security and defense exist to protect the information society  It is common sense that the society is vulnerable to the so called cybernetic threats  thus the science of security becomes necessary to preserve the basic attributes of the information  confidentiality  integrity and availability  Disrespect to any of those attributes could generate harm in the micro scale  individuals  interests  and at the macro scale  affecting the critical infrastructure of the information systems of a determined country 

 

May we like it or not  we live with insecurity in this world since our ancestors were primates and it is so true that to analyze and to mitigate risks are innate attributes for all of us and we do it all the time even in an unconscious way 

 

In the science of security  mitigate the risk means to apply ways of control and  being aware that the world  control  is cause of discomfort to the ones that  like us  respect and fight for freedom  it is necessary to mention that control can be of a preventive  detective  corrective or compensatory nature 

 

When of the law enforcement  treating common crimes in a global perspective  the law enforcement agents search for evidences  something that unequivocally relates an action to an individual  In the  real world  this evidence could be obtained by the analysis of DNA found in the crime scene  for example  In the cyberspace  the only way of finding this important correlation  which might mean to acquit someone is through interpretation of audit trails 

 

There is a forensic principle that can also be applied to the digital world which is called Locard s Exchange Principle  This principle indicates that  every contact leaves a trace   meaning that every time two or more objects meet  there is an exchange of material 

 

By allowing the unrestrictive anonymity on the internet - which would happen if the metadata of individuals were not stored anymore – we would be switching off the lights of public parks  More than that  we would not only be switching off the lights  but also distributing masks 

 

Granting the rights of unrestrictive privacy  which could benefit some people  would also create an environment with perfect conditions for all kinds of crime  Between privacy and anonymity  order and chaos  there is a balance that needs to be found 

 

We may not forget that the commercial internet is the internet of dot-com  This internet is the same one used by our children and our parents  is an internet where anonymity could generate a very significant impact in people s lives since  as people say  the internet is a permanent mural  that once written cannot be erased  Imagine the internet s capacity of destroying reputations simply because some people trust the internet as an unequivocal source of information  while calumnious data may be put there on purpose with the very objective of spreading false information about people  companies or government 

 

Imagine the hundreds of hidden services from the darknets emerging at the surface where criminals would find a safe environment for trading organs  human traffic  child pornography  illegal commerce of guns  drugs and assassins  Nowadays  the internet has become somehow dangerous for those criminals and they have migrated to the deepest layers of the web  We could be bringing them back 

 

But how could we guarantee the anonymity of the ones who want to express their ideas without the risk of being punished by whoever may be interested on those ideas not being revealed? There are already tools for that to be done  Cryptography is far beyond being a sophisticated technical resource to become a technology available to whoever wants to transmit data without having personal information being revealed  For having a mathematical base  cryptographic algorithms may be easily analyzed for verification of its reliability 

 

One of the alternatives to be discussed by the actors of the internet in the world is the role of the state agencies in which concerns surveillance and maintenance of audit trails (logs) and  mainly  in the confidential storage and control of its use  We do not believe the internet would be better and safer by not keeping records of the actions taking place at the cybernetic environment  In addition  it is necessary to define rights to the civilian agencies that serve as a spokesman of the minorities 

 

 

ABOUT THE PERSPECTIVE OF THE NATIONAL SOVEREIGNITY ON THE INTERNET 

 

It is visible that the critical services of the countries are more and more based on the internet  like bank and post services  mobile communication  electronic government and  not less relevant  applications related to the interests of individuals  Would the countries today have conditions of preserving such important critical infrastructure on their own or they depend on services that are under the guardianship of other States?

 

We all know the answer  There is an excessive concentration of power on the hands of a few States  while the majority of the other States operate as if they were  clients  of a service  This dependence happens in basic services of the Internet (e g  DNS)  data logistics (e g  cables and satellites) and applications (e g  e-mail services  social networks) 

 

When conflicts arise  the internet is even more relevant  Affecting network communications can mean stopping basic services  generating chaos and unmeasurable financial losses  Such a relevant infrastructure needs to be considered as critical by the countries 

 

The term  information weapon  was created to classify some technological artifacts as  high impact  when operated against enemy installations  Differently from what happens with traditional warlike arsenal which may be difficult to access for the militias  the information weapons can be used by individuals without the need of much resources  The usual form of cybernetic attack is a person with technical competence and a computer connected to the internet  This simplification vulgarizes this kind of attacks 

 

On the other hand  the concentration of power related to the management of the internet infrastructure gives an expressive advantage to some States in cases of conflicts  This advantage has been built over the past decades  in a veiled way  with investments in technology and infrastructure 

 

The new conjuncture of power should consider the balance of the forces based on the power of the information weapons  be it for the militias or for the great world potencies  This is the future of war which will happen at the so called  fifth frontier  – the cybernetic space 

 

Thinking about the cybernetic space as a war environment is a view that can be validated on some news affirming that some States count on  armies  of at least        cyber soldiers 

 

In this context  our proposition is that the new internet governance conjuncture – and resulting distribution of power – may allow a better balance and autonomy of the world potencies and the rest of the world  This is not a simple challenge  as it requires sensitive topics to be discussed in an open and frank way 

 

 

ABOUT THE NEED FOR INTEGRATION IN FIGHTING CYBERCRIME

 

Another topic that needs discussion is related to standards and procedures in fighting cybercrime  The lack of specific laws and regulated procedures  or even the different ways in dealing with them in different countries  makes it easy for cybercriminals to operate in a relative safe way  since they can  for example  steal data from someone in the other side of the world without even leaving their bedrooms  As the frontiers in the cybernetic world are way more open than in the physical world  criminals have changed their way of operating to take advantage of that 

 

More than an integration of the countries and their intelligence agencies against such crimes  it is very important that everybody involved in that fight exchange information and align their methods to make that fight more effective  It is not only responsibility of the governments and police to engage that battle  since it would be very difficult (not to say impossible) for them to search the whole web for those crimes  Private Cyber Security companies and Internet Service Providers (ISP) should also join that fight so that cybercrime can be combated in an effective way 

 

Since the methods of investigation of cybercrimes are different from the physical world  it is very important that each actor plays its role  the private cyber security companies identifying the threats  ISPs removing them from wherever they are hosted and the government intelligence agencies and the police investigating the criminals  It is also important to highlight that different kinds of crimes need different kinds of treatment and this is something that also needs to be discussed  Online fraud  for example  is very different from unauthorized use/commerce of intellectual property and should be treated as such 

Introduction

 

Noting the reference points established to guide the activities at the event called International Multilateral Meeting on Internet Governance  to be held in Sao Paulo  Brazil  on    and    April       and bearing in mind that only through collaboration among all participants will be possible to build understandings that can be widely accepted  we offer related to the topic Principles for Governance and Internet the present contribution 

 

As certainly mentioned in other contributions  there are a number of documents from various institutions  aimed to identify and explain the principles that lead to continuous innovation and expansion of the Internet  What highlights the importance  usefulness and adequacy of the Internet to people's needs  Indeed  the acceptance of several of these principles occurs regardless of laws or other instruments and the practical results remain the permanent innovation and expansion of the Internet in all parts  with the most varied models and solutions 

 

In view of this   a fundamental element to be preserved by any principles is that the Internet is an open  think tank  to all people interested  and free to introduce innovations and to receive or not the acceptance of users who freely exercise their power of choice and opinion 

 

The international event of São Paulo itself reflects an important element of the Internet  which is open participation to all parts and the construction of results from a free and committed participation to the development of Internet  as occurs regularly in numerous other international  regional and local meetings of these same stockholders 

 

The meeting provides another opportunity to continue to build on the foundations already established  and to share documents  positions and views on the Internet  in particular regarding its governance and its future development 

 

Internet and Governments

 

Currently there are several discussions about the need for public policies and legislation about rules to use the Internet  Because of this  the meeting is an opportunity to demonstrate that it is not possible or advisable to restrict creativity  freedom of choice and expression  which cannot be subject to restriction  repression or control  among other interests of the people

 

The information available globally produces unimaginable events of sharing without the use of the Internet  such as  a musical success attended and enjoyed by people from different parts of the world thanks to the global network  as well as the views of the conflicts that unfortunately following part of the daily life of the world community  or even shared personal interests

 

Share information  opinions and broaden your social network  among others  are conditions that people with access to the Internet already incorporated as part of their daily lives  and these conditions must be ensured by all involved in the process of Internet Governance

 

In this sense  it is worth noting that the so-called cyberspace or the Internet is not an alternative reality from that we live in  but a tool that each of us uses in their day to day to make life better 

 

Social networks  which have always existed  it was only magnified by the Internet  making what was already part of the everyday and the result of the free will of each 

 

When using the Internet all valid principles that govern our lives in society still applied  as well as human rights  freedom of expression and all other consecrated by various national and international institutions 

 

Therefore  the Internet reflects the use made of it by the people  for this reason should continue to be an open  free and comprehensive tool 

 

Internet and telecommunications services

 

Unlike telecommunications services  subject to national and international regulation  the Internet is a global platform that uses telecommunications services to connect users and computer networks  and is characterized as a Value Added Service in various national and international laws and is included in the deals of the world trade treaty of the World Trade Organization (OMC) 

 

Note that the Internet was developed to make possible the use of any telecommunication service and is this model that ensures a free and open use of the Internet by anyone  a fact that distinguishes the Internet design of the design of telecommunications services 

 

At the beginning  the Internet technique and technologies was seen as "unfit for professional applications" by the telecommunications industry   however  over time this technique began to be used by the telecommunications industry and is now considered the only solution to the so called "technology convergence" 

 

A great change of opinion of experts in telecommunications in a relatively short time   especially if we consider that the attempts like the Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) object of studies and recommendations of the International Telecommunication Union ( ITU ) which was designed to be the way for the future for telecommunications 

 

The flexibility and low cost of Internet technique and technologies enabled numerous technical changes in the telecommunications industry  until the Internet itself becomes the object of desire of large corporations in the industry who spare no efforts in trying to transform the Internet in the converging telecommunications service as a natural path for the future of telecommunications 

 

The discussions involving the Internet sector and the telecommunications sector has spread worldwide to the point that in many countries the regulation began to consider the use of effective measures (legal) to ensure the free and open use of the Internet and no interference of telecommunications operators in the uses and the choices of users by conditions established by the telecommunications services used 

 

The possibility that commercial interests can be the excuse to impose limitations or restrictions on the freedom of access and choice of Internet users and eventually affect the proper functioning of the Internet can be a reality in a very short time  This theme just gaining notoriety and is subject of discussion in many countries and international forums under the title " Network Neutrality " 

 

However  little is discussed about the future of the telecommunications industry and this discussion is essential to the future of the Internet   as without telecommunications services widely disseminated not only access the Internet but the actual evolution of interconnection of computer networks that form the Internet will be limited 

 

The universalization polices of telecommunications services already includes the aspects required for such services also serve to access the Internet? If restrictions are present to Internet use  what development of telecommunications services will be necessary?

 

This element requires studies and considerations so the policies of universal telecommunications services will include the appropriate scenarios  taking into account the support for Internet use 

 

In this respect  it is noteworthy that universal services will continue to be needed  plus a new feature to ensure that any person using the universal telecommunications service can even use it for Internet use 

 

Internet Governance

 

Many would like to take the Internet Governance due to its growing importance to society  In some situations proposals to do a "recreation" of the Internet as if a huge mass of users were demanding such changes 

 

The current model of Internet Governance  created from actions of a few countries and a lot of volunteer work in various sectors of society  is undoubtedly responsible for the success of today's Internet   This model " multi stakeholder " enables greater participation so that more countries can join the existing governance effort   making the governance entities in forums of global representation  

 

For this process to take place the various Governments need to ensure alignment of public policies related to telecommunications infrastructure and the Internet to ensure that will be no barriers to the development and evolution of Internet governance under the mentioned model 

 

National and international legal and economic structures should enable the use of the Internet in activities such as electronic commerce  tele-education  telemedicine  among others  for innovations that can improve people's lives may arise 

 

Civil Society Participation in Internet Governance is essential to add the view of those who use the Internet and accordingly reflect acceptance  discontent  wishes and especially the credibility and reliability in the use of the Internet that represent the power of choice of the people 

 

The private sector participation in Internet Governance is essential to offer the vision of entrepreneurs and "think tanks  creations responsible for all the innovative use of the Internet and the use of resources and infrastructure as required 

 

The academic sector participation in Internet Governance is essential to offer the vision of researchers and scientists forming stimulating innovation and knowledge bases that are essential to everyday society 

 

Therefore   these and other segments of society must be present in the institutions engaged in the Internet Governance   and must be involved performing work together to ensure the principles of freedom of expression  freedom of choice  freedom of access to information and ideas  democratic participation  innovation and encouraging the development   distribution and accessibility of the Internet for everyone 

 

The principles set out below  did not want to be an exhaustive list and should be treated according to the dynamics of evolution of the Society in order to preserve the Internet and its evolution as a tool to serve the interests of the people and accepted by most stakeholders involved in the construction and expansion of the Internet 

 

The principles are not original  but based on the Principles for Governance and Use of Internet developed by the Internet Steering Committee in Brazil (CGI BR) 

 

   Freedom  privacy and human rights

 

The use of the Internet must be driven by the principles of freedom of expression  individual privacy and the respect for human rights  recognizing them as essential to the preservation of a fair and democratic society 

 

A global  open and free nature of the Internet must be assured as a common good in the global scope  The use of free and open way should be preserved as the essence of the Internet platform repudiating justifications commercial  technical  legal or political that can be presented to disregard this principle  The rule of law must be the basis for any legislation on Internet use States should ensure full compliance with its obligations under international law 

 

   Democratic and collaborative governance

 

Internet governance must be exercised in a transparent  multilateral and democratic manner  with the participation of the various sectors of society  thereby preserving and encouraging its character as a collective creation 

 

The Internet Governance should be exercised jointly by various segments of society that should work together collaboratively  through transparent and open processes to public opinion with broad debate and that reflect the needs  ideas and desires of users Internet and to refrain from any measurement of violating human rights  equal and democratic participation  respect for the rule of law or jeopardize the global and open nature of the Internet 

 

   Universality

 

Internet access must be universal so that it becomes a tool for human and social development  thereby contributing to the formation of an inclusive and nondiscriminatory society  for the benefit of all 

 

Access to the Internet should be possible from any telecommunications service without discrimination  both as users involved  such as the use of the Internet  Public policies aimed at universalization of telecommunications services should include provision that such services need to be able to support the use of the Internet in appropriate conditions 

 

   Diversity

 

Cultural diversity must be respected and preserved and its expression must be stimulated  without the imposition of beliefs  customs or values 

 

Public policies should ensure the right to access information and opinions when using the Internet expanding the possibilities of knowledge and dissemination of cultural diversity through the World Wide Web 

 

The same rights that people have disconnected from the Internet should also be protected online 

 

The effectiveness of privacy protection can only be achieved with the collaboration in global scope 

 

   Innovation

 

Internet governance must promote the continuous development and widespread dissemination of new technologies and models for access and use 

 

Public policies should encourage innovation and dissemination of new technologies to access and use the Internet and limit to the minimum possible tributary  commercial and industrial requirements 

 

   Neutrality of the network

 

Filtering or traffic privileges must meet ethical and technical criteria only  excluding any political  commercial  religious and cultural factors or any other form of discrimination or preferential treatment 

 

The use of the Internet must be done freely and according to the choice of each user and are valid all the principles that govern our lives in society  as well as human rights  freedom of expression and all other rights enshrined in various national and international institutions 

 

   Unaccountability of the network

 

All action taken against illicit activity on the network must be aimed at those directly responsible for such activities  and not at the means of access and transport  always upholding the fundamental principles of freedom  privacy and the respect for human rights 

 

Companies that develop the tools used on the Internet cannot be held responsible for the use that people make of these tools or by content created or inserted by a third party 

 

   Functionality  security and stability

 

The stability  security and overall functionality of the network must be actively preserved through the adoption of technical measures that are consistent with international standards and encourage the adoption of best practices 

 

Public policies should encourage the use of infrastructures that support the functioning  security and stability of the Internet  particularly in the use of telecommunications resources across countries

 

   Standardization and interoperability

 

The Internet must be based on open standards that facilitate interoperability and enable all to participate in its development 

 

States should encourage the use of open standards that facilitate the operation of the Internet and to ensure that regulation of the telecommunications industry do not establish restrictions or other constraints that compromise the interoperability of the Internet 

 

Moreover  public policies should consider the use of limited resources (radio spectrum) to access and use the Internet  especially in cases of solutions to support private or public computers networks 

 

    Legal and regulatory environments

 

The legal and regulatory environments must preserve the dynamics of the Internet as a space for collaboration

 

States should ensure that the legal and regulatory environment does not offer different constraints or barriers of the cases dealt with in the context of the process of Internet Governance 

The Internet is changing lives all over the world   Once connected  people have access to job opportunities  products  and services that were previously unthinkable   People also rely on the Internet for entertainment and culture   We know from recent studies that consumer demand for online content is skyrocketing  which is driving broadband deployment  To ensure continued and sustainable growth of the Internet  the entertainment and cultural industry supports a governance structure that   

 

·         Benefits from meaningful participation by all interested parties  which requires that stakeholders share knowledge and information 

 

·         Fosters growth and innovation  which means systems must be interoperable and intellectual property rights protected  and

 

·         Ensures a safe  stable  and secure Internet supported by the rule of law and the sovereign rights of states  consistent with international norms and the principles of a free and democratic society 

 

These concepts stem from the      Tunis Agenda for the Information Society   While the foundation for these principles was laid in Africa  we look forward to continuing the dialog in South America at the Netmundial conference in Brazil  and to future discussions in other international fora

According to the ITU (Guadalajara Resolution           )   cybersecurity  is a  set of security tools  policies  concepts  drivers  risk management methods  actions  education  awareness  good practices  insurances and technologies to protect users and organization assets in cyberspace  

 

As stated by the  Global Cybersecurity Center (GCSEC)    DNS security  stability and resilience (DNS-SSR) have a direct and strong impact on the performance and dependability of nearly all aspects of interactions on the Internet  including Web applications  Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) based systems  cloud infrastructure and distributed applications in general  which constitute a foundation for high performance and scalable services computing  putting always more demands on the DNS infrastructure  by increasing requirements for higher performance and improved dependability    DNS-SSR needs more and better efforts on awareness and tech capacity building/training   Gaps in talent always means Gaps in security    ICANN SSR Working Group  as well as Global & Regional organizations like LACTLD  LACNIC and ISOC  and also ccTLD s and TLD Registrars are working hard on this at this time  

 

 Big Data  rapid adoption  defined as exponential volume and complexity of data under management  is drastically changing the way  online privacy  needs to be handled and guaranteed   New generic TLD s (nTLD's) economy and business will impose a lot of challenges to cybersecurity as well  in particular to the Internet s Domain Name System (DNS) 

 

The weakest element in information security is the HUMAN factor   As a result  organizations need to constantly improve their awareness programs (employees must be more conscious of their information security responsibilities and appropriate use of assets  IP data and technology  info-sec should be part of their performance assessment) and introducing new security instruments  examples can be (a)  -step authentication for high visible enterprise (PR  marketing  channel management) profiles  (b) sharing passwords strongly prohibited (to avoid cases like Snowden gaining admin/social confidence with NSA workers)     % of the solution is NON-TECHNICAL  it s case of  good IT  Security  Operations and Business Governance  

 

In terms of cybersecurity framework and strategy deployment  there are good ways for government  civil society and private sector to share information and work toward same goals and challenges  a strong and aligned cooperation effort involving relevant stakeholders is urgently needed globally  regionally and in-country  especially to work together on hardening critical infrastructures  fight against cyber-crime and cyber-delinquency  as well as stability and resilience issues 

 

 Identification  is one of the most relevant challenges in cybersecurity today (specially for Law Enforcement and National Security agencies)  services helping individuals and organizations for  going dark  by handling network anonymity and identity  particularly in  domain names   as well as advanced encryption and wiretapping techniques  give particular interest benefits but contribute fraudulent  illegal  abusive and malicious activity to increase in cyberspace 

 

False information published online  as a result of human mistakes or deliberate actions  could have complex social  political and economic consequences to actors involved (i e   hacking to AP twitter s account for publishing fake information about White-House explosion and U S  President s injury caused stock and marketing uncertainty)  

 

Several countries recognize cyber-attacks more dangerous to their national security than terrorist ones  and face them as serious threats to the country safety from a political  economic  social and technological perspective 

 

 Hacktivism  seen as the usage of IT hacking methods to stage protests and make political statements  is another big challenge for today s cybersecurity  political activists  cyber-insurgents and mischief makers continue to increase DDoS attacks and take advantage of IT vulnerabilities every day 

 

Individuals and organizations needs to understand cybersecurity is not just a technological and compliance issue  it s a business risk that implies and requires an enterprise-wide approach and an innovative approach and response to the unknown challenges new technologies bring ahead  

 

Inaction or inappropriate preventive and proactive personal/corporate information security measures  as well as not making nor maintaining framework based and continuously reviewed  rethought and potentially redesigned policies  can lead to seriously affect the image/brand and reputation  disrupt business and operational continuity and lead to a host of financial and legal issues 

 

Every organization s member needs to fully understand and be conscious of the overall consequences of cybersecurity breaches  theft of funds  data leakage/loss  Intellectual Property (IP) are not the only inherent risks associated with  there are costs associated with losses of profits and business as well as the high expenses associated with remediation  

 

Breaches eventually could derail key objectives  undermine the confidence of shareholders  analysts and customers  and affect business and operational continuity  financial performance  ultimately reducing revenue and company s overall market value 

 

For as much progress as organizations have made  many of them still have a long way to go   As the rate and complexity of cybersecurity incidents continue to increase  they need to act quickly to avoid leaving themselves exposed to a costly and brand-damaging security incident that shakes the confidence of consumers and shareholders 

 

People and organizations aspiring to be  information security innovators  need to set their sights on new frontiers   They need to continuously review  rethink and potentially redesign their entire information security framework in order to be better prepared  In many cases  innovating may require a fundamental transformation of the information security program to proactively fortify against both the known and the unknown risks in the cyber risk environment   the future  

 

Organizations need to be more  forward-looking  in cybersecurity   As being ready to handle security and risk considerations with  digital devices  (smartphones and tablets  software applications  web/mobile-based apps) and  social media  (a digital business enabler and networking facilitator)  they should have been preparing for current technologies as they were appearing on the horizon 

 

Finally  if resources are still working to improve capabilities for emerging technologies and trends that are right in front of organizations or already behind them  then they will have no time to prepare a defense that proactively protects the organization from technologies that are just (a)  around the corner   big data  enterprise app store (which encompasses associated costs vs  increased productivity of employee request for apps)  supply chain management (in the context of how external assets like customers  suppliers  vendors  contractors and partners impact security)  cloud service brokerage (how brokers/partners manage cloud security  privacy and compliance issues)   bring your own cloud   as well as those which about to appear (b)  on the horizon   in-memory computing (data storage in RAM instead of DB s allowing real-time analysis of high-volume data)  Internet of things  digital money (and regulations and legislation required to address fraud and money laundering issues related with mobile money services) and cyber-heavens (where countries provide data hosting without onerous regulations)
